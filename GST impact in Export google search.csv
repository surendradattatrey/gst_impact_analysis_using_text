Due to this, there is a constant amount of anxiety that is prevailing among the people running the export-import business in India. With the help of this article we can get a clear picture of how the GST bill will affect the export and import business in the country. IMPORT Only after some Amendments are made in the constitution can the GST be levied on the imports as presently there are no acts present in the Constitution of India for the GST to be levied. Irrespective of the fact that if imported goods are produced domestically or not, CGST and SGST will be levied on international imports at the time of importation. Incidence of tax as per convention will take its destination principle and the revenue from the tax from the SGST will be earned by the state in which the imported products are consumed. Having entered into various free trade activities, it is a difficult task for India to utilize customs duty as an exercise to ensure a balanced playing field. Now there are various endeavors to consider foreign goods on the same level as domestic goods. Previously importers would use to get benefits on custom duties. They would have to pay a negligible amount on the imported goods which they used for the making of export goods. No such special treatment would be offered to the import goods in the new GST act. GST will be levied on the goods that are imported irrespective of the fact they will be used for re-exportation or not. The General Sales tax act will guarantee this by enforcing CGST and SGST on the imports. Therefore, a balance will be created for the domestic industry and the production sector in regard to the imports. GST legislature would be drafted on destination based principle thereby: 1. On imports in between different businesses, SGST is to be levied and remitted to the state where the imports are located irrespective from where the products have entered the country. But the destination needs to be mentioned on the import invoice to mean the address of the importer. 2. You should collect the SCST on business to consumer goods and they should me remitted to the state. Here the place of residence of the person is to import the goods regardless of the fact from where the goods have been bought. They are not interested in the original location of production of the goods. Import Taxes That Would Carry On There are certain definite duties which cannot be subsumed 7under the GST regime even having after the introduction of the duties. These duties are as under: 1: Basic Custom Duty 2: Anti- Dumping Duty 3: Safeguard Duties There have been rising industries even after the production of the GST. They are the gaining sectors of leather products, furniture and fixtures, coal and lignite, agricultural machineries, industrial machinery and other machinery which iron and steel as for example the coal and steel and railway transport equipment, printing and publishing equipment and tobacco products. There are several moderate gainers which include the metal products and the nonferrous metals. It also includes transport equipment and other railways. Imports are expected to decline in the market. These include the textile and the readymade garments, mineral and beverages, coal, crude oil and petroleum and gas and iron ore. EXPORT You can structure the GST on the destination principle. In this way, exports escape the burden of GST by zero rating. The goods that are exported without charging VAT are referred to as the Zero- rating goods. These VAT which are paid can also be refunded. Therefore the goods are exported on shorn of taxes. Countries having VAT using resort to zero rating of exports. There are several export taxes which are bound to carry on. They include: Export Duty This might not be subsumed under the GST regime SEZ With the help of GST, you can make sure that all the producers and distributors are treated as complete pass-through and the exports are guaranteed to be zero- rated. In this way, one cannot possibly exempt directly. There is a definite purpose for setting up SEZ. It was to motivate and encourage the production of goods which are to be exported out of India. In this way, even after one withdraws, this would directly benefit the units which are set up in SEZ and would still continue to enjoy exemption in respect of goods and services exported by it. You would be taxed if you sale anything by SEZ to the domestic Tariff Area. There is a similar law which deals with the exemption of SEZ. Foreign Trade Policy There are certain exemption schemes which are available under the Foreign Trade Policy 2009-2014. There are also certain central excise and custom legislation which might be available. Although there is discussion about some government duties and documents prepared, there are exemptions which are currently available under custom legislation.

1," Exporters need to prepare for GST | Business Line Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs Exporters need to prepare for GST AJAY SRIVASTAVA · print · T+ · T- Tweet KR DEEPAK Don’t stop the flow Of goods and money This entails paying taxes and claiming refunds, causing working capital to be locked up. This issue, however, can be resolved GST will usher in a new regulatory regime for India’s exports. For the manufactured product exporters, the most significant impact would be the increased requirement and blockage of working capital. For manufacturing a product, a firm buys locally or imports raw material and machinery. The current export schemes allow firms to buy these without payment of applicable duties through ab-initio exemption or subsequent refund of duties. The proposed GST system mandates that all duties must be paid at the time of a transaction while refund for these can be obtained after exports. This means the exporter will have to arrange money for the inputs, manufacturing and payment of duties and taxes. Export schemes The current system of export schemes has evolved over the decades. For example, the Advance Authorisation Scheme that allows duty-free sourcing of raw material is in existence since the 1970s. The Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) scheme that allows duty-free sourcing of machinery was introduced in early 1990s. Both schemes have been used extensively by engineering, electronics, automobile, chemical, petrochemical and pharmaceutical sectors to build an export base. The Special Economic Zones (SEZ) scheme, though introduced in 2005, was already in existence in some form since the mid-1960s. Jaya’s story Most of India’s 130,000 exporters who currently use these schemes must comprehend the post-GST impact of the changes. We do it through the example of Jaya, a medium-sized garment exporter from Coimbatore. Jaya just got an export order from a buyer in Germany for supply of 10,000 linen shirts at $100 each. We will have a look at the current export options available to Jaya and how these will change post GST. Jaya will need to buy linen fabric and manufacture shirts from it. She can either import or buy it locally. Her manager tells that the total customs duty would be 24 per cent of the import value of the linen. Jaya can use the Advance Authorisation Scheme for import of the required quantity of linen from Italy. Currently, she need not pay any duty on imports. However, post-GST, while she will get an exemption from payment of only basic customs duty (7 per cent), she has to pay Integrated GST which (let’s assume) will be around 18 per cent of the import value. She can get the refund of this duty only after exports and realisation of money. Considering a value addition of 15 per cent and cost of capital at 12 per cent, Jaya’s working capital equal to 15.65 per cent of export value will be blocked for six to 12 months. Post GST, Jaya cannot use the two regularly used variants of Advance Authorisation. One, currently she can buy linen from a domestic manufacturer who will supply without payment of duty. Post GST, the domestic manufacturer cannot supply without charging duties. Two, currently, Jaya can buy linen from domestic market paying full duty, manufacture the shirts and export. She can subsequently use the authorisation to import linen without payment of duty. Post GST, this option will not be available. Jaya needs to buy textile machinery for making quality garments. She currently imports duty-free using the EPCG scheme. In return, she has to undertake to export garments six times the value of the duty saved amount in six years. Alternatively, if she buys machine from an indigenous manufacturer, she will have to export 25 per cent less compared to what she would have had to had she imported the machine. This way EPCG scheme nudges exporters to use indigenous machines. Post GST, imports under EPCG will become expensive. She will have to pay IGST which may be around 18 per cent of the import value. This money may be blocked up to six years, the time allowed under EPCG scheme to complete exports. For an import value of ?100, if Jaya takes a loan at 12 per cent for paying IGST of ?18, she may have to return about ?35.5 after six years. This high additional cost will affect the viability of many enterprises. Worse, since capital goods do not get consumed in the process, it may be difficult to link specific capital goods imports with the specific exports and in that case no GST refund may be a likely scenario. Another option currently available to Jaya is buying duty paid linen from the domestic market and using the drawback scheme for obtaining refunds of duties paid. Currently, the drawback scheme largely refunds the basic custom duty and other central duties paid on buying inputs. However, post GST, the schemes will refund basic custom duty only. The other central duties will be refunded through the GST mechanism on a case-to-case basis. SEZs, EOUs, deemed exports Currently, the SEZ developer and units can import their requirements duty-free. Also, the supplies made by the domestic units to SEZs are considered exports and hence are free from payment of taxes and duties. Not anymore. The model GST law defines exports as taking goods and services out of India to a place outside India. And India is defined to include the Exclusive Economic Zones lying at 200 nautical miles beyond territorial waters. Since SEZs are within Indian territory, these would be reduced to the status of a normal domestic firm. This means, no duty or tax exemptions on imports or exports would be admissible. Imports into SEZ will attract IGST while supplies to SEZs will attract CSGT and SGST or IGST. With average value addition at SEZ already less than 10 per cent, the new law may make many SEZs unviable. The GST will also affect the supplies defined as deemed exports. Currently, the supplies to projects under International Competitive biddings (ICB), mega power plants and World Bank funded projects are exempted from central taxes. This has been done to enhance competitiveness of Indian firms participating in global tenders or large scale bids. Post GST, these supplies, currently termed as deemed exports will become taxable where no refund would be available. GST will block working capital The provision of no exemption and only refund will lead to blockage of about ?1,85,500 crore annually for the manufactured goods exporters. This figure considers export value of $200 billion, an average 30 per cent value addition over the inputs and cost of capital at 12 per cent. Capital at 12 per cent in India is way too high compared to 0-1 per cent in most developed countries. And secondly, most SMEs can’t get capital even at 12 per cent. The more sophisticated a product, higher is the need for external sourcing of inputs, leading to higher requirement and blockage of working capital. Resolving working capital issue The working capital blockage issue can be resolved without compromising the integrity of the GST model. Allow firms to pay tax on transactions leading to exports through e-currency. This would be of the nature of an IOU where a firm would agree to set off its IOUs with the actual payment within an year or at the time of the completion of exports, whichever is earlier. A firm can be allowed to use IOUs equal to the value past year’s export performance. This solution keeps the current GST framework of making payment first, refund later, intact.

3," GST Impact on India’s Exports | LinkedIn LinkedIn Sign in Join now Main content starts below. GST Ready India GST Impact on India’s Exports Published on February 8, 2017 GST Ready India Follow Following Unfollow GST Ready India Sign in to follow this author Editor at gstreadyindia.com The government of India has provided various fiscal incentives and exemptions to promote export in the country. Industries for which exports play a crucial role are oil and gas, IT, electronics, agriculture, automobile, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The GST is expected to foster dollar revenue for these industries. Various export promotion schemes such as the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) will continue after the GST. Coupled with this, duty exemption and remission schemes offered by the government are expected to get a boost with the new tax structure. The number of ways in which GST will impact tax incentives and export competitiveness are discussed below. Gains to Exporter After the GST implementation , exporters will be able to capitalize on the refunds and rebates from the taxes which will come under the ambit of state taxes (SGST). The refund and rebate on the export of services is likely to be increased substantially after the GST rates are applied. To make the refunds easier, government has ensured that all the relevant data on GST rates will be available online which tends to do away with the verification of documents. A large number of organizations are actively looking for ERP systems that are GST compliant and will provide them competitive benefits. Export Drawback Scheme The GST is expected to alter the nature of tax incentives currently under the export drawback scheme and the rate of duty draw back. As per market experts, the rate of duty drawback will go higher. However, no definitive decision by the government has been reached so far. It is a concern for exporters to know if the import duty amount is presently waived off against few exemption schemes. If this continues after GST, traders and exporters will need foreign exchange from overseas buyers to complete their products. Currently, there is lower or no customs duty on imports. After the GST is put into effect, there will be zero rating of exports leading to an inverted tax structure which will prove beneficial. As a result, input credit will be accumulated and can then be regularly claimed for refunds. Thus, manufacturers will be placed at par with importers. Level playing field for domestic manufacturers and importers The GST will ensure zero rating of exports which will offer a competitive edge to the Indian exports. The government of India has already offered various export-linked tax incentives extended under the Foreign Trade Promotion (FTP) which includes various schemes such as Served from India Scheme (SFIS), Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCG), Focus Market Scheme (FMS), Establishment of Export Oriented Units (EOU), Focus Product Scheme (FPS), and Special Economic Zones (SEZ). The objective of exemptions under FTP is to offer relief to traders and manufactures by sparing them from various central levies such as Central Excise duty, Customs duty, and Central Sales tax. After the GST implementation , there will be changes in the nature of exemptions against SGST and CGST. GST will ensure that the state taxes are also covered under these schemes. SEZ Gains to be Impacted The GST is expected to put an end to various tax & duty exemptions enjoyed by the SEZ developers. This may dampen investment, at least for the near future. In the current regime, the SEZ developers and units import their requirements without any duty or tax. In addition, all the supplies from the domestic suppliers to SEZ developers are exempted of any tax or duty, since they are considered exports. However with the GST to put into effect, this will change. The SEZs will no longer be considered in the ambit of exports as they are technically considered within the domestic border of the country. This will render SEZ equivalent to other domestic firms and are likely to attract different tax components of the GST—CGST, SGST or IGST. This means that the SEZ units are treated as equivalent to any DTA exporter. Hence they have to claim refunds of any unutilized input tax credits in GST. The government is trying to make the refund of the claims easier for all stakeholders. GST may Affect Working Capital for Exporters Traders who are fully dependent on exports can claim refunds on the exports but will have to first obtain duty paid inputs. Replacing exemption with tax refunds will block a significant capital—Rs. 1,85,500 crores in a year, according to an estimate—for all manufactured goods exporters. The exporters will need separate refund applications for all SGST and CGST/IGST refunds and approval by various authorities will delay the whole process. This is a practice that has drawn criticism from exporters. Furthermore, what makes the refunds more unviable is the law that the interest rate for delayed payments by assesses is at 18% while for any delay by tax authorities it is mere 6%—which may lead to a loss to exporters. Coupled with that, most companies, especially SMEs, face difficulty in obtaining working capital. Businesses which manufacture products that require advanced technology and expertise are in higher need for external sourcing of capital. After the GST is put into effect, companies will face significant constraints in marketing their products. To sum up… Although, evaluation of the impact of GST on exporters and indigenous traders is yet to be conclusively made, unarguably, the new tax structure will enhance the competitiveness of Indian export. On the whole, the GST will ensure that the process of getting tax incentives is streamlined and made easier for the stakeholders. In addition, the GST is also likely to expedite the process of getting various refunds for exporters, thereby boosting the overall economy of the nation.

Ushering in a new tax regime with S Krishnamurthy, Adjunct Faculty Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a part of the proposed tax reforms that center around evolving an efficient and harmonized consumption tax system in the country. Presently, there are parallel systems of indirect taxation at the central and state levels. GST is proposed to be a comprehensive tax levy on manufacture, sale and consumption of goods as well as services at a national level. The introduction of goods and services tax will lead to the abolition of taxes such as octroi, Central sales tax, State level sales tax, entry tax, turnover tax, tax on consumption or sale of electricity, taxes on transportation of goods and services, and eliminate the cascading effects of multiple layers of taxation. In this interview with Prof. S. Krishnamurthy, faculty in the Finance and Control area at IIM Bangalore, we explore the possible challenges and impacts of the implementation of GST. Common man and GST Tejas: Why is the Indian Government keen to move towards a Goods and Services Tax regime? Do the benefits, such as de-cascading and simplification of taxation, correction of market distortion, replacement of indirect taxes and other benefits justify the huge cost and effort which is needed to make the transition to the new regime? SK: As of now, the central government charges excise duty and service tax while the state government charges sales tax or VAT. For interstate transactions, we have Central Sales Tax which is an origin based tax while VAT is consumption-based tax. There are complications and issues due to the multiplicity of taxes. So, India is trying to follow other countries like Canada and Australia, where there is seamless tax structure, where both the central and state governments get revenue from all transactions. Therefore GST is at two levels ? the State GST and the Central GST. Additionally we have the concept of manufacture, sale and deemed sale etc. All of this would be replaced by one word-?supply?. So when business to business supplies of goods/ services are there, these will be charged the Central and State GST which would be equally shared by the centre and the states. Therefore there would be no separate excise duties, separate sales tax, service tax, etc. Presently, every month, assessees have to file several returns before different authorities: CST returns, VAT returns, Entry tax returns, CenVAT returns, Service Tax returns etc. Now, under the GST, there?ll be only one return per month for the entire business. This one return per month, will capture everything. This would reduce complications and streamline collection of taxes at various points. The benefits would definitely outwiegh the costs. Tejas: With a 3-tier tax rate under GST, levies on common items of consumption would be affected. Should a better model for GST be in place? SK: I don?t think there?ll be any change because it is basically a consumption tax you are arriving at. So business entities are not going to bear the burden; it will be passed on ultimately to the customer. But unbilled or black purchases will come down because if one person purchases from another without bill, he cannot claim the benefit of GST credit. So, necessarily he has to have a bill. Already that system is in place, so that means invoice based trade will be much more. The problem that they are working on is, India is too large and a lot of transactions occur in the unorganised sector thereby ?an entry level turnover exemption? is being worked out. For central GST, the minimum is Rs. 50 lakhs, and for the state GST, it is Rs.5 lakhs to be taxed under GST. Implementation woes Tejas: The GST model has been criticized in Australia as a regressive tax model, with a more pronounced effect on lower income earners. Also, after the tax came into effect, the Australian economy saw negative economic growth for the first time in more than 10 years. How will the implementation in India be different and overcome such problems? SK: I would say it is not correct to compare Australia, because their total population is minuscule compared to ours and their federal structure is also quite different. Probably Canada is more comparable to us. Tejas: It is quite evident that sound IT infrastructure is needed to share tax-related information among the states. Do you see a well-spread out implementation by April 2012, given we do not have good IT facilities in all states? SK: We do not have excellent IT infrastructure as of now, but it is being ramped up. There are some states that are not going forward with proper implementation either due to their financial constraints or due to political reasons. Southern states have done quite well, if you consider Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Gujarat. In the South the people and the government are more aware of IT and it is being put to good use but there are issues in the North. Tejas: We see wide disparity in GST applicability and GST rates around the world (Austria 20% from 7% in Singapore to 20% in Austria), each rate being dependent on the economy of the country. Revenue neutral rate, as shown in the study of NCAER and Task force report is 12% while the proposed GST rate in India is 16-20%. How is the most suitable rate arrived at and how does a sub-optimal or excess rate affect the economy? SK: The same rate of tax would be applicable for both CGST and SGST- if SGST is 8%, CGST will also be 8%. The states are already receiving some tax revenue which they should not lose. In fact, the states already have revenue neutral rate (RNR) of 12.5% in VAT. This was the outcome of extensive statistical analysis and study. RNR, as of now, is only on VAT, whereas we are now going to add central excise tax which is at 10% as of now (reduced from 16% temporarily). The service tax is at 10% (because of the economic downturn the rates were brought down from 12%). Now again the rates would go up. So the state?s rate is at 12.5% and central government rates are different. So now you have to have an RNR which is for both the central and the state you can say an ?Indian RNR?. Impact on key industries Tejas: The finance ministry?s draft proposal for the GST regime proposes to keep crude oil, petrol, diesel, ATF and natural gas permanently outside GST to protect finances of states, which rely heavily on collections from levies on oil products for their budgetary targets. But the oil industry has demanded the inclusion of crude oil and its products to avoid fuel price variation from state to state. Do you think the oil industry?s demand is justified? SK: It is the same case in almost all countries. The problem with fossil fuels is that of availability, hence there is a high dependence on imports. Our maximum foreign exchange outgo is on oil, and we have no control over the prices. That is the reason why under WTO also, India has not made any binding commitment as to the maximum duty to be charged. Under the WTO binding, India has said that three items would not be bound to a fixed rate of duty ? petroleum, fertilizers and consumer products. For rest of the items, bound rates have been put in place. Tejas: Recognizing that the current indirect tax regime is adversely impacting export competitiveness of the country, a study by National Centre for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) has said that the proposed Goods and Service Tax (GST) regime will be beneficial for India?s foreign trade engagement with the rest of the world. Which export oriented industries would benefit from the implementation? How would it impact the imports? SK: Exports industries would not be affected much under GST as exports would be zero-rated. All tax paid can be claimed back as tax credit. Imports are always subject to customs duty and when the imports enter the states, anyway the states will tax and receive the state GST. Dilemma of the states Tejas: The states resist the implementation of GST because of the losses of revenue from a wide range of taxes (such as the State Sales tax, Luxury tax) they can levy. The Centre has promised to compensate the states for whatever losses they incur due to the new tax regime. Is it reasonable to do so? SK: The government says that it will make compensatory funds available so that the national integrated tax system is implemented successfully. About Rs.50 thousand crores have been set aside for compensation to the states which is a temporary amount and would not be required forever. Tejas: The states believe that a single GST rate would be regressive and rob them of fiscal autonomy. Do you see a strong rationale in this argument? SK: The states are inhibitive because the CST is being revoked. Earlier the CST was reduced to 2% from 4% and will finally be revoked due to GST which could result in loss of revenue to the states. This is an apprehension of the states, which is not necessarily true. A lack of understanding and comprehension is the cause of this worry and proper training and knowledge sharing is needed. There were about two years of problem when VAT was introduced, now VAT has taken off well. So this is actually introduction problem. Unfortunately , there are two issues they are trying to solve at the same time :DTC and GST. DTC is more populist from the point of view of the common man because it deals with income tax. Most probably GST would be completely rolled out by October 2012. Conclusion Despite the complications being faced with the implementation of GST, its realized benefits in terms of ease of operations, a more seamless taxation regime, reduction in black market activities and minimal cascading effects of different tax levels are worth considering. To an extent, it may make some sense to compare India with the other economies with GST but on a larger scale there are stark differences and performance of other economies are no indicators of the effects GST would have on India. There is definitely a need for better infrastructure to help in the efficient implementation of GST and cooperation from the states too. Therefore, as per our discussion with Prof. S. Krishnamurthy Goods and Services Tax is a step in the right directon for the Indian Economy.

5," GST Impact on India’s Exports Search for: GST Ready India GST India Latest News and Updates Home Industry Featured Consumers Latest News GST Impact on India’s Exports By GSTReadyIndia Jan 06, 2017 The government of India has provided various fiscal incentives and exemptions to promote export in the country. Industries for which exports play a crucial role are oil and gas, IT, electronics, agriculture, automobile, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. The GST is expected to foster dollar revenue for these industries. Various export promotion schemes such as the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) will continue after the GST. Coupled with this, duty exemption and remission schemes offered by the government are expected to get a boost with the new tax structure. The number of ways in which GST will impact tax incentives and export competitiveness are discussed below. Gains to Exporter After the GST implementation, exporters will be able to capitalize on the refunds and rebates from the taxes which will come under the ambit of state taxes (SGST). The refund and rebate on the export of services is likely to be increased substantially after the GST rates are applied. To make the refunds easier, government has ensured that all the relevant data on GST rates will be available online which tends to do away with the verification of documents. A large number of organizations are actively looking for ERP systems that are GST compliant and will provide them competitive benefits. Read: India Exports Forecast 2016-2020 Export Drawback Scheme The GST is expected to alter the nature of tax incentives currently under the export drawback scheme and the rate of duty draw back. As per market experts, the rate of duty drawback will go higher. However, no definitive decision by the government has been reached so far. It is a concern for exporters to know if the import duty amount is presently waived off against few exemption schemes. If this continues after GST, traders and exporters will need foreign exchange from overseas buyers to complete their products. Currently, there is lower or no customs duty on imports. After the GST is put into effect, there will be zero rating of exports leading to an inverted tax structure which will prove beneficial. As a result, input credit will be accumulated and can then be regularly claimed for refunds. Thus, manufacturers will be placed at par with importers. Level playing field for domestic manufacturers and importers The GST will ensure zero rating of exports which will offer a competitive edge to the Indian exports. The government of India has already offered various export-linked tax incentives extended under the Foreign Trade Promotion (FTP) which includes various schemes such as Served from India Scheme (SFIS), Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme (EPCG), Focus Market Scheme (FMS), Establishment of Export Oriented Units (EOU), Focus Product Scheme (FPS), and Special Economic Zones (SEZ). The objective of exemptions under FTP is to offer relief to traders and manufactures by sparing them from various central levies such as Central Excise duty, Customs duty, and Central Sales tax. After the GST implementation, there will be changes in the nature of exemptions against SGST and CGST . GST will ensure that the state taxes are also covered under these schemes. SEZ Gains to be Impacted The GST is expected to put an end to various tax & duty exemptions enjoyed by the SEZ developers. This may dampen investment, at least for the near future. In the current regime, the SEZ developers and units import their requirements without any duty or tax. In addition, all the supplies from the domestic suppliers to SEZ developers are exempted of any tax or duty, since they are considered exports. However with the GST to put into effect, this will change. The SEZs will no longer be considered in the ambit of exports as they are technically considered within the domestic border of the country. This will render SEZ equivalent to other domestic firms and are likely to attract different tax components of the GST—CGST, SGST or IGST. This means that the SEZ units are treated as equivalent to any DTA exporter . Hence they have to claim refunds of any unutilized input tax credits in GST. The government is trying to make the refund of the claims easier for all stakeholders. Read: How GST will impact government export promotion schemes and incentives GST may Affect Working Capital for Exporters Traders who are fully dependent on exports can claim refunds on the exports but will have to first obtain duty paid inputs. Replacing exemption with tax refunds will block a significant capital—Rs. 1,85,500 crores in a year, according to an estimate—for all manufactured goods exporters. The exporters will need separate refund applications for all SGST and CGST/IGST refunds and approval by various authorities will delay the whole process. This is a practice that has drawn criticism from exporters. Furthermore, what makes the refunds more unviable is the law that the interest rate for delayed payments by assesses is at 18% while for any delay by tax authorities it is mere 6%—which may lead to a loss to exporters. Coupled with that, most companies, especially SMEs, face difficulty in obtaining working capital. Businesses which manufacture products that require advanced technology and expertise are in higher need for external sourcing of capital. After the GST is put into effect, companies will face significant constraints in marketing their products . To sum up… Although, evaluation of the impact of GST on exporters and indigenous traders is yet to be conclusively made, unarguably, the new tax structure will enhance the competitiveness of Indian export. On the whole, the GST will ensure that the process of getting tax incentives is streamlined and made easier for the stakeholders. In addition, the GST is also likely to expedite the process of getting various refunds for exporters, thereby boosting the overall economy of the nation.

Significantly, she also said job creation is being prioritised with government policies and proposals before the Union Cabinet being analysed from an employment-generation perspective. “The way in which fitment discussions have happened in the GST Council and the way commodities and services have been treated, the GST is only going to help in improving our exports and in making exports more competitive (in the global market),” Ms. Sitharaman told reporters. “Also, the refund mechanism has been fast-tracked with the assurance that amounts will be refunded within seven days of the receipt of complete application in most cases, and that all cases of exporters will be addressed within three days. The medium-term review of the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) is being carried out to align FTP with GST.” Job creation On job creation, she said Prime Minister Narendra Modi is keen that proposals before the Union Cabinet and government policies are analysed from a perspective of generation of direct and indirect employment generation. On efforts to boost employment in the North East, the Commerce & Industry Ministry and NITI Aayog are in talks with the north-eastern states to soon bring out a new North East Industrial & Investment Promotion Policy (NEIIPP). The NEIIPP, 2007 had expired in March this year, she said. On India’s exports, Ms. Sitharaman said the consecutive positive growth in shipments (witnessed in the past eight months) is a “sustainable trend”, adding that Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), Services Exports from India Scheme and Interest Equalisation Scheme have helped in improving India’s export performance. As per the Commerce Ministry, exports that availed MEIS in FY’16 recorded a lesser contraction in growth as against those that did not make use of MEIS, while shipments that availed MEIS registered a positive growth in FY’17 vis-à-vis the negative growth in exports that did not avail MEIS during that fiscal. India’s exports of consumption and hi-tech goods have increased, reflecting a shift to greater shipments of value-added goods from the country. Africa, Latin America Ms. Sitharaman said her ministry was making efforts to boost India’s exports to relatively new markets including Latin America and Africa. Appreciating India’s growing project exports to Africa, Japan has expressed interest in collaborating with India in this regard, she added. On rupee appreciation impacting exports, the minister said Indian exporters are seized of the currency fluctuation, adding that though the rupee is market-determined, whenever there are extreme fluctuations in the currency, the RBI takes measures to address the situation. On other issues, she said there was no plan to shift the Rubber Board from Kerala to the North East, adding that the government was making efforts to boost rubber exports. On Telangana government’s proposal for a new Turmeric Board, the minister said currently there is no move for a separate Turmeric Board as all spices fall under the Spices Board’s purview.She said, however, that there could be spice parks in that state dedicated to turmeric for value-addition and warehousing. Ms. Sitharaman said the government was also favourably inclined to extend the Chennai-Vizag industrial corridor to Kolkata via Odisha. On Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), she said the government was committed to continue with its policy reforms to ease norms, adding that the cabinet will soon consider the proposal to replace the Foreign Investment Promotion Board with a new mechanism.

Share on Twitter. Share on Google+ GST impact The proposed Goods and Service Tax (GST) law will significantly impact the manner in which businesses function. We look at GST impact on companies in the fields of Information Technology (IT) and consultancy services. Taxes on provision of services Consultancy businesses are currently governed by the provisions of the service tax law. With effect from July 1, 2017 they will be governed by the provisions of the GST law. Among other matters, the model GST law prescribes the nature of tax that would be levied on services rendered. It would be relevant to discuss place of supply guidelines . If the supply (i.e. provision) of service happens within the boundaries of a state, the service provider would be required to charge Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST) simultaneously. If the supply happens outside the boundaries of a state, Integrated GST (IGST) would be levied on the value of supply. This is a significant shift from the existing manner of levying service tax, which is a single levy pan-India. In the GST era, the service provider would be required to charge three types of taxes depending on the location of the customer. Enhanced ability to take input credit GST greatly enhances the ability to take input credits on taxes paid on inputs that are used in the ‘furtherance of business’. This means that service providers will be able to take input credit of taxes paid on goods that are used to provide output service. Notwithstanding the restrictions proposed by the model GST law, business entities will be in a far better position to benefit from taxes paid to procure inputs vis-a-vis the existing indirect tax laws. This is especially relevant in the case of IT companies who invest significant amount of money in tangible technology infrastructure which are covered under Value Added Tax (VAT) or Central Sales Tax (CST). The levy of VAT / CST results in increased costs and impacts businesses adversely. GST has done away with this anomaly by absorbing VAT / CST & service tax under one levy. This change is one that will be welcomed by IT companies. Impact on accounting and financial systems GST would also change the manner in which business records have to be maintained. IT companies, given their expertise in using technology, would be better equipped to meet these challenges. Business transactions have to be recorded keeping in mind the requirement of the GST law, especially with respect to tracking output & input taxes. There are specific restrictions on the utilization of tax credits and these have to be given attention while setting up the finance systems. Further, rules governing invoicing guideline are released. Many service companies have automated the system of generating invoices. These systems will need to be revised to meet the requirements of the GST law. Treatment of exports Exports are currently ‘zero-rated’. The term ‘zero-rated’ means that the service provider does not have to charge and pay and tax on the value of the export (i.e. the exports are taxed, but at 0%). Though, the service provider can claim refund of all taxes that are paid on services consumed as inputs (i.e. taxes on eligible expenses of the business). The government has given this benefit to encourage exports. There are, however, certain practical difficulties for claiming refund of input taxes. GST brings us some great news – not only do exports continue to be zero-rated, the procedure for claiming refund of input GST has been greatly simplified. The application for refund shall be automatically processed online. This will have a positive impact on the cash flows of service providers engaged in export of services. In conclusion, the segment of consultancy services comprises of a plethora of businesses. While we have tried to bring out the impact of GST at a very broad based level for the service industry as a whole, an analysis of individual businesses in detail would determine the real impact of GST.

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade under the commerce ministry has been meeting legal and tax consultancy entities on the issue. Particularly on scrip-based incentives such as the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) and the Services Exports from India Scheme. The ministry or its agencies issue a scrip to an exporter to be used for payment of central taxes such as Customs duty or excise duty and service tax on future procurement of goods and services. Such modes of payment would not be allowed after the GST regime begins. Significant changes to these schemes are not expected, owing to their scale and the lack of alternative ones. “MEIS benefits are also given to exporters for the processing part, i.e any loss incurred due to inefficiencies in the government processing part of the export. On that note, any major changes to the scheme will affect exporters significantly,” says L Badri Narayan, taxation partner at law firm Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan. While exports will remain zero-rated under GST, there is also confusion on schemes under the Customs department such as the Export Promotion of Capital Goods one and the Advance Authorisation Scheme. While the mid-year review of the FTP was scheduled for September, the imminent introduction of GST has given rise to the debate over whether it should be advanced. The five-year (2015-20) policy provides a framework for boosting of export of goods and services, besides creation of employment and increasing of value addition. It sets a target of export of goods and services to $900 billion by 2020; the figure in 2016-17 was $275 billion. GST is aimed at reducing of existing duty exemptions, is one argument.

12," www.gstindiaonline.com - Articles - Window to GST <<Back To Archives of Articles Window to Goods & Service Tax (GST) by Jyoti Raj Tax Consultant, Mr. Jyoti Raj, has in this interesting and detailed article discussed the broad contours of the proposed Dual GST, the concepts and likely procedures. He has also analysed the impact of GST on Individual Industries. Mr. Jyoti Raj is the Associate Consultant to STVAT Consulting in Uttaranchal GST to reduce Manufacturing Cost The proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) would reduce manufacturing cost and benefit end-customers, Nothing that the Indian manufacturing sector was highly taxed. The elimination of multiple tax structure at central and State levels would make the sector viable and globally competitive. ?Our manufacturing sector is one of the highest taxed sectors in the world. Even a two per cent reduction in production cost will increase profits by over 20 per sent, giving headroom for reducing prices and benefiting end-users?. The GST will be a dual tax with both central and state GST component levied on the same base. There will be no distinction between goods and services for tax purpose with a common legislation applicable to both. Implications of GST on imports & exports Basic Custom Duty will continue to there under GST system. However, the additional custom duty in lieu of CVD /Excise and the Special Additional Duty (SAD) in lieu of sales tax/VAT will be subsumed in the import GST.The import of services will be subject to Central GST and State GST on a reverse charge mechanism. In other words, the GST will be payable by the Importer on a self declaration basis. Place of supply rules will determine which state will have the authority to get the tax. However, the taxes so paid will be available as Input Tax Credit and therefore it would be a revenue neutral. Exports, however, will be zero rated, meaning exporters of goods and services need not pay GST on their exports. GST paid by them on the procurement of goods and services will be refunded. Impact on Pharma Industry The Indian Pharmaceuticals Industry (IPI), estimated turnover at 450 billion, ranks fourth globally in terms of volume and is amongst the largest producer of Pharma products in the world along with USA. Japan, Europe and China. The cutting edge that IPI enjoys over most other nations is the cost advantage, given that the cost of labour and overall production is lower in India as compared to other nations. To cite an example, the manufacturing cost of Pharma products in India is nearly half the cost incurred in the US. But the multistage taxation in the Pharma Industry i.e. Customs Duty on imports, Central excise duty on manufacture, Central Sales Tax (CST)/VAT on sale of goods. Service tax on provision of services and levies such as entry tax, Octoroi, cess by the State or Local municipal corporations/ municipalities is one of the key stumbling block in its progress. Levy of multiple taxes, loss of credit of tax paid, compliance and litigation cost associated with the present tax set up are causing problems to the Pharma Industry. Introduction of GST is a positive step and if implemented in the right spirit could result in reduction in transaction cost. The most visible and immediate impact of GST appears to be the proposed discontinuance of (Central Sales Tax (CST) levy. As on date, CST is a cost to Pharma manufacturers whenever they procure raw materials from outside their state and if sale is on inter-state basis. This is on account of the fact that CST paid in purchases cannot be set off against the local value added tax (VAT) liability of manufacturer/ dealer. Though, over the last couple of years CST rates have reduced from four to two percent, the said levy continues to be a cost to the manufacturers and traders dealing in interstate transactions. The phasing out of CST with the advent of GST could do away with the perennial issue of credit leakage on this front. Another evident impact of GST would be a definite re-look and review of the present warehousing strategies followed by the Pharma Industry. As it stands on date, most Pharma manufacturers maintain warehouses in different states to evidence movement of goods from one warehouse to another so as to save on the CST. Also, quite a few entities set up warehouses on hitherto attractive locations like Pondicherry or Daman as the CST rate at such locations were previously lower than the rate at such locations were previously lower than the rates prevalent in other states. Warehouses across various states and movement of goods thereof have been a nightmare to the Pharma Industry from the logistics perspective ? not to mention the increased compliance requirements and transaction costs. With GST in the anvil, Pharma manufacturers can set up warehouses for distribution at select strategic location without looking at the same tax planning options resulting in cost of operations. Currently, certain locations such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttranchal enjoy an excise tax holiday on their manufacturing activities. However, since the output is exempt the tax paid in inputs/capital goods tend to be a cost to the entitles located in such areas. Though, area based exemptions may not continue in the GST era, based on past experience of VAT and on a generic basis, it appears that the presently exempted units may be required to pay GST on their finished goods but, would be entitled to claim refund in order to ensure continuity of GST at every stage. By doing so, the credit chain remains intact and at the same time incentives already agreed by the Centre and the State Government for both Central and State Level GST is passed on to the manufacturers. Such a move would ensure that the various manufacturing hubs of the Pharma Industry in said areas continue manufacturing operations in such locations. Pharma goods attract excise duty at 4.12 percent whereas the Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (API), which are inputs for manufacture of Pharma products typically, attracts duty at 8.24 percent. The difference n duty rates of inputs vis-à-vis the finished goods has resulted in accumulation of differential Cenvat Credit for the manufacturers not engaged of export of Pharma goods. The Central Excise/Cenvat Credit legislation does not provide any mechanism for refund of such accumulated Cenvat credit. With the Central GST presumed to have a single rate for both goods and services, going forward accumulation of credit may cease to be an issue for the industry. It is not clear as on date whether the proposed GST will have transitional provisions to carry forward the unutilized accumulated Cenvat credit from the Central excise law to Central GST legislation and how the same would be implemented. Impact on Auto Industry The Auto Industry is sensitive to the changes in the economy as well as fiscal policy and is accepted as the barometer of economic well-being of a country. The imminent introduction of the goods and service tax (GST) replacing central excise duty, service tax, state value added tax (VAT) and central sales tax (CST) may change the way business is done today. The Practice in this industry is to sell vehicles to a dealer network that sells as well as services the vehicles. More than 80% of the sales is generally outside the state of manufacture. The distribution of the vehicles may be by way of direct sales to dealers, currently subjected to CST or by stock transfers to depots and stockyards across the country. Both these models entail a tax cost, which gets embedded in the final price to the customers. Though the rate of CST cannot be set off by the dealer against his VAT liability. Similarly, though stock transfers are not eligible to tax, state VTA laws provide for retention or reduction of input tax credits. Currently, stock transfers do not attract any tax (other than the loss of input tax credit in the exporting state). It is possible GST would be applicable on all ?supplies' including stock transfers. This would have its own challenges. The valuation of such stock transfers have to be tackled as there would be no sale value available to calculate tax. There could be significant cash flow issues as well. Special transition provisions will be required for the in-movement stock from factory to depot on the date of introduction of GST. Most of the new investments by auto companies have gone to the states that have offered most competitive tax incentives. Such incentives are largely in the form of subsidies/loan equal to the VAT/CST paid in the state govt. For instance, under the GST regime, the state of manufacture will not collect any existing incentives (in terms of CST exemption/deferral) can continue. Himachal Pradesh etc would also be effected. One of the reasons for auto component manufacturers to set up units close to OEM plants is to avoid breaking of the VAT credit chain. The removal of CST in the new regime would provide a new opportunity for consolidation of theses units into larger units, which would be good for economic efficiency of the sector as a whole. If the GST rate is fixed anywhere between 16-18% as being discussed currently, it may be a good news for the industry. The current effective rate works out to be more, particularly for the bigger cars, where the excise duty is higher. Impact on Logistics Sector The introduction of a national sales tax in India next year could have a similar impact on freight demand as the creation of the European single market and customs union, according to leading logistics operations. Logistics firms are building warehouses and logistics parks across India as the country gets ready for a centrally administrated goods and services tax (GST). The GST will standardize rates across the nation, allowing many corporations to move away from having warehouses in different states to adhere to each state tax code and employ logistics companies to manage distribution and supply chain. With GST coming in place, a lot of consolidation is expected in this space. The case for having a warehouse in each state will disappear. Let's hope GST is Good & Simplified Tax !!! Prev 1 2 3 4 "

14," GST and services exports: Back to pre-negative list era? Growth may well get affected - The Financial Express SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Opinion GST and services exports: Back to pre-negative list era? Growth may well get affected GST and services exports: Back to pre-negative list era? Growth may well get affected The proposed withdrawal of the upfront non-taxability of services exports may inhibit growth. By: Rajeev Dimri | New Delhi | Published: March 4, 2017 3:09 AM It would be important to understand the impact of GST on businesses before its implementation. There has been significant headway recently over the Goods & Services Tax (GST). It is expected that the final GST laws, as approved by the GST Council and passed by Parliament, would be available in the public domain later this month for the reference of industry. Timely roll-out of the final structure is imperative in order for India Inc to prepare itself for the paradigm shift in indirect taxation. It would be important to understand the impact of GST on businesses before its implementation. Although GST is expected to bring uniformity and simplicity in trade taxes, at the same time, it appears that in certain aspects, it may be important for businesses to re-think their existing models in order to seamlessly transition. Services exports is one such area. Historically, exporters of goods and services have been incentivised in India, as these businesses leads to an increase in forex reserves and fosters the nation’s growth. From a tax policy perspective, since implementation of negative-list regime, services exporters have been fairly incentivised—their revenues are not subject to service tax, and central indirect taxes on procurements are largely offset by refunds. Against this backdrop, the implications of GST regulations on the business of service exporter need to be carefully assessed. The Model GST Law prescribes IGST on all inter-state supplies of services. To determine the nature of any supply and its place of supply (which will determine the levy of IGST), ‘Place of Supply Rules’, largely similar to the existing set of rules, have been drafted. These rules and other relevant provisions of the Model Law suggest that if any service has been provided from India, but its place of supply lies outside India, then it would be deemed as an inter-state supply of service, thereby attracting IGST. Thus, even if the place of supply for any service lies outside India, the service will be taxable in the first place. However, the Model Law has retained the existing policy of zero-rating services exports. It , along with the draft invoicing rules, indicate the possibility of export under bond or availing refund of IGST if ‘export conditions’ are fulfilled. These conditions are similar to those prescribed under the Service Tax Rules at present. These new measures will effectively convert the existing, simplistic and upfront ‘no-tax treatment’ on export of services to potentially a more rigorous ‘export under bond’ procedure or a rather complex ‘pay and refund’ model. Such provisions take the services exporter back to the era of pre-negative list regime wherein but for fulfilment of export conditions, services were liable to service tax. Hopefully, the final version of the GST law and rules should clarify that the export under bond procedure will apply only on goods, and not on services. Lawmakers need to appreciate that these administrative changes in the current draft form, in relation to service exports, would not only impact large-scale exporters but would also affect several thousands of freelancers serving foreign clients through the internet. They might have to bear the burden of undertaking additional GST compliance, thereby adding to their compliance costs. A reference must be drawn from the current tax regime as services provided outside India have been kept outside the ambit of service tax so far, in a manner that there was no tax on such services. At present, if the place of provision of a service lies outside India, depending on fulfilment of prescribed conditions, it may be considered an export/exempt service. However, it seems that under the provisions of the Model GST Law, if any of the export conditions are not met, even though the place of supply lies outside India, it could attract IGST. Also, no refund opportunity would be available for such a supply. Thus, a service supplied outside India would be stripped of the ‘no-tax’ treatment. This does not seem to be in line with the principles of GST, which is a destination-based consumption tax. If the final GST law is introduced with these provisions, there is the possibility of extra-territorial jurisdiction challenges. Furthermore, one of the conditions to qualify for exports is that the subject transaction should not be between two establishments of the same legal entity. This implies all cross-border intra-legal-entity transactions qualifying as supply will be subject to GST, irrespective of their place of supply. At present, such transactions do not attract service tax if the place of supply is outside India. Also, the Model GST Law doesn’t clarify whether a book adjustment with approvals in terms of forex laws will qualify as a valid foreign exchange receipt. Interestingly, the Model GST Law provides for two different sets of rules for determination of place of supply, one for domestic transactions and another for cross-border transactions. Thus, taxability of a service transaction could be entirely different if it is provided to an overseas recipient vis-à-vis domestic customer. Such differential treatment of domestic vis-à-vis cross-border service could lead to a lot of confusion in determining taxability of services, particularly in cases of back-to-back transactions having a domestic as well as cross-border piece.

The nation has high hopes from GST, and no compromises should be made in its structure that could jeopardise it.

Suryamurthy New Delhi, April 30 : Exporters have expressed their concern over GST blocking their working capital as they would have to first pay the taxes and then claim refund. ""Exporters are not used to paying any taxes. The implementation of GST, which is good for trade and industry, would, however, block the working capital of exporters,"" Ganesh Kumar Gupta, president of Fieo, told The Telegraph . ""If taxes are to be refunded, it would be better to continue with the existing system of exemption ... locking of working capital is not a good move."" ""The basic issue is providing liquidity for the exporter or for the state. The exporters have to borrow at a market rate of 14 per cent, whereas states can borrow at 6 per cent,"" Gupta said. According to estimates, working capital of Rs 1.85 lakh crore working capital will get stuck annually with the government under goods and services tax (GST). This would push up the manufacturing cost of the exporters as they have to borrow more from banks. Early refund ""GST clearly provides that taxes must be paid and that refund will be provided. So since the regime is so structured, the department of revenue has committed that 90 per cent of the refund will be made within seven days. Delays beyond that would invite interest payment,"" commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said. She said exporters would be paid interest if the refund got delayed beyond two weeks. However, the interest rate has not been specified. For the remaining 10 per cent, the minister said it would be subject to whatever verification the revenue department is required to do. Gupta said: ""Fieo has taken up this issue with the working group set up by the government on GST."" Rules for SEZ Gupta said there was no clarity on whether I-GST (integrated GST) was to be payable in special economic zones. ""If I-GST is not payable in the tax-free zones, then the SEZ Act needs to be amended. Since SEZs are custom-bound areas there is a case for providing exemption from I-GST. This would provide an advantage to these zones and boost exports."" In the current regime, SEZ developers and units import their requirements without any duty or tax. In addition, all the supplies from the domestic suppliers to SEZ developers are exempt from any tax or duty as they are considered exports. Officials, however, said in the GST regime, SEZs will be technically considered within the domestic border of the country and render them equivalent to other domestic firms and are likely to attract the different tax components of the GST - CGST, SGST or I-GST. So, they would have to claim refunds of any unutilised input tax credits in GST. Strong rupee Expressing concern over the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, Gupta said certain incentives in the form of interest subvention being offered to manufacturers may be extended to merchants and other exporters. He said the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) across sectors can somewhat offset losses on account of the rupee appreciation. Gupta said he would be meeting the commerce minister and finance minister to discuss this issue.

Many among these are those who would like to shift their base to some other country at least temporarily in order to practice the profession of Company Secretary there. In keeping with the wishes of our members, the Institute’s delegation whenever it visits any country makes it a first point to interact with the concerned authorities emphasizing upon them the competencies of our members and the potential contribution they could make if an opportunity was afforded to them. We, in the series of our renewed efforts, took up with the representatives of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries & Administrators [ICSA]-UK, the matter of transfer of ICSA- UK membership secured by our ICSI members after successfully completing the related examinations of ICSA- UK in accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding [MoU] with them. Good news now to share with you all ! A clear understanding has been arrived at with the ICSA- UK to the effect that an ICSA- UK member may transfer his membership inter se its various divisions. Accordingly, an ICSI member who has, and those who may after pursuing ICSA Course where under one is required to clear the following three papers, all other papers having been exempted in terms of the MoU : Corporate Governance Corporate Secretarial Practice Chartered Secretaries Case Study may secure the membership of ICSA- UK. Where an ICSI member, who has also secured the membership of ICSA- UK, desires to shift base to another division, say from India to Singapore, he is now eligible to have his ICSA- UK membership transferred to the Singapore division– Singapore Association of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.. For the benefit of all concerned, given below are answers to some common question that are being frequently asked by our members in relation to the above matter : Q-1. Which all are the divisions to which transfer of ICSA-UK membership be sought? A. The divisions are – (i) Australia [Governance Institute of Australia, www.governanceinstitute.com.au ] (ii) Canada [Chartered Secretaries Canada, icsacanada.org ] (iii) Hong Kong [The Hong Kong Institute of Chartered Secretaries, hkics.org.hk ] (iv) Malaysia [The Malaysian Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators (MAICSA), www.maicsa.org.my ] (v) New Zealand [Governance New Zealand Inc. (GNZ), http://www.governancenz.org/ (vi) South Africa [The Southern African Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, chartsec.co.za l (vii) Zimbabwe [The Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators in Zimbabwe, http://www.icsaz.co.zw l (viii) Singapore [The Singapore Association of the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators, www.saicsa.org.sgl Q2. Whether a person, after getting membership of ICSA- UK, eligible for transfer of his said membership to any other division (as mentioned above) ? A. Yes. A member of ICSA- UK may seek transfer of his membership to any other division. Q-3. Is a ICSA- UK member desirous of transferring his membership to any other division required to pass any additional examination of such other division? A. No. No other or additional examination are required to be passed. Q-4. Are there any other condition(s) required to be complied with when transfer of ICSA-UK is sought to any other division? A. Yes, there are few usual requirements, e.g. that the person seeking transfer of his membership is in good standing. Similarly, certain transfer fee is also required [which may vary from division to division]. For example, if an ICSA member in Canada desires to get his membership transferred to Australia, such a member would need to establish contact first with the Canada division with a request to intimate his membership particulars to the division in Australia. Thereafter, the said member may get in touch with the Australia division. As is obvious, transfer of ICSA- UK membership may be sought to a division to which one is moving. Such transfer and thereupon the membership of the newer division would hold good so long as the ICSA- UK member does cease to be resident of such division. Further, ICSA-UK membership can be held at a given point of time of any one division. Q-5. After his membership transfer to another division, say Singapore, he will be required to pursue any other course and seek any other membership of such division? A. No. Upon transfer, one gets the membership of the division to which his ICSA- UK membership has been transferred. For more details, while one may visit https://www.icsi.edu/WebModules/AboutUs/Courses/icsa.htm , it is always advisable, in one’s own interest, to establish contact with the division to which the transfer of ICSA-UK membership is sought.

It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016 , following the passage of Constitution 101 st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance Minister of India - Arun Jaitley . This method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. [1] Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST. Introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax [2] would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent. GST is expected to be applicable from 1 July 2017. [3] Contents 1 History 2 Effects of GOODS SERVICE TAX (GST) 3 GST on Exports 4 Legislation 5 GSTN 6 GSP 7 ASP 8 References 9 External links History [ edit ] Tax Regime in India The reform process in indirect tax regime of India was started in 1986 by Vishwanath Pratap Singh by introduction of Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT). [4] Goods and services tax (GST) will subsume various indirect taxes including central excise duty , services tax , additional customs duty, surcharges , state-level value added tax and Octroi. [5] [6] Other levies which are currently applicable on inter-state transportation of goods are also likely to be done away with in GST regime. [7] [3] The following taxes will be bound together by the GST: Central Excise Duty Service Tax Countervailing Duty Special Countervailing Duty Value Added Tax (VAT) Central Sales Tax (CST) Octroi Entertainment Tax Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Advertisement taxes Taxes applicable on lotteries [8] GST is levied on all transactions such as sale, transfer, barter, lease, or import of goods and/or services. India will adopt a dual GST model, meaning that taxation is administered by both the Union and State Governments. Transactions made within a single state will be levied with Central GST ( CGST ) by the Central Government and State GST (SGST) by the government of that state. For inter-state transactions and imported goods or services, an Integrated GST (IGST) is levied by the Central Government. GST is a consumption based tax, therefore, taxes are paid to the state which the goods or services are consumed not the state in which they were produced. IGST simplifies tax collection for State Governments by enabling them to collect the tax owed to them directly from the Central Government. Under the previous system, a state would have to deal with multiple state governments in order to collect tax revenue. [8] Effects of GOODS SERVICE TAX (GST) [ edit ] The tax rate under GST may be nominal or zero rated for the time its charged. It has been proposed to insulate the revenues of the States from the impact of GST, with the expectation that in due course, GST will be levied on petroleum and petroleum products. The central government has assured states of compensation for any revenue losses incurred by them from the date of introduction of GST for a period of five years. [9] GST on Exports [ edit ] Under the GST Law, export of goods or services are treated as Zero rated supplies, therefore, GST will not be charged on the export of goods or services. The credit on inputs used for making export supplies will be available to the exporter. The exporters have two options either to export goods under Bond and claim refund of input credit or to export goods under rebate claim and claim the refund of output tax. [10] Legislation [ edit ] The goods and services tax (GST) council chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley has urged states to approve state GST laws by the end of May to smoothen the roll-out of the historic tax reform by its target date of 1st July. [11] As India is a federal republic , GST would be implemented concurrently by the central governments. [12] A 21-member select committee was formed to look into the proposed GST law. [13] Section 9 is the charging section for CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017), which gives power to central government to levy tax on intra state taxable supply. [14] There will be no GST on the sale and purchase of securities. That will continue to be governed by Securities Transaction Tax (STT). [15] GSTN [ edit ] Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a nonprofit organization formed to create a platform for all the concerned parties i.e. stakeholders, government, taxpayers to collaborate on a single portal. The portal will be accessible to the central government which will track down every transaction on its end while the taxpayers will be having a vast service to return file their taxes and maintain the details. The IT network will be developed by private firms which are being in tie up with the central government and will be having stakes accordingly. The known authorized capital of GSTN is ? 10 crore (US$1.6 million) in which Central Government holds 24.5 percent of shares while the state government holds 24.5 percent and rest with private banking firms. [16] GSP [ edit ] GSP stands for GST Suvidha Provider. To handle the huge IT requirements, the government, GSTN has entrusted GSPs with the responsibility of providing the much needed support to taxpayers in the IT ecosystem for GST. But, while the extent of support provided by a GSP may be limited to providing enriched access to the G2B portal, support provided by ASPs will extend much further and will address most taxpayer compliance difficulties. ASP [ edit ] ASP stands for Application Service Provider. ASPs will act as a link between the taxpayers and the GSPs. ASPs will focus on taking taxpayers’ raw data on sales and purchases and converting it into the GST returns. This GST returns will then be filed on behalf of the filer with GSTN via the GSP. It’s a kind of sub-license generation. Major ASPs include ClearTax , JioGST, sahiGST etc. [17] References [ edit ] ^ http://www.idtc.icai.org/download/BGM-on-GST-march-15.pdf ^ ""Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be subsumed under GST? - GST India Forum"" . gstindia.net .

18," How GST will work for software exporters | ProductNation - The industry watering hole for software product industry. An iSPIRT initiative Policy Hacks How GST will work for software exporters Sudhir Singh GST council has yesterday cleared all the bills required to implement the GST. Finance minister wants to kick-start from July 1 2017. This can be easily achieved is the model laws can be enacted in the current session of parliament. The GST is therefore set become a reality from the second quarter of the current financial year. GST is going to catalyze greater IT adoption. We can see the business going digital in future and a Digital India emerging. Apart from receiving GST as a catalyst for Software product industry growth, we also need to get prepared for adopting GST our selves. Not everyone has prepared for GST though. At iSPIRT we are starting discussion group on GST so that community can take advantage from shared learning. This blog is the first in series of this effort. Few fundamental changes in the Goods and Service tax (GST) as it is called are It is supply based and not sales based tax system Being an indirect tax, it applies where the consumption happens There are three statues and taxes that are part of GST i.e. SGST (state GST), CGST (Center GST) and IGST (integrated GST = SGST+CGST) Both state and center will get tax on Goods and services supplied unlike earlier only Center received the service tax The GST subsumes many of the indirect taxes prevalent at present GST will significantly change the way of doing business. Also, it is bound to greatly impact the international trade regime e.g. excise duty will merge in GST and deemed exports benefits under excise laws may come to an end. The exports aspect will impact Software exporters, irrespective of whether they are operating under SEZ, STP, EOU, EPCG or outside as these export schemes. GST on Import is going to impact every one, as in globalized world with cloud penetration, everyone is bound to use goods and services imported. In this blog we cover in brief the application of GST on the import and export of goods and services. How it impacts Import? Basic custom duty (BCD) is not covered under GST and it will remain same. There will be two components on each import to be paid i.e. Basic Duty + IGST. IGST will subsume currently applicable countervailing duty (CVD) and additional duty of customs (SAD). Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) means tax levied under this Act on the supply of any goods/services in the course of inter State trade or commerce. IGST has two components SGST and CGST. A supply of goods/services in the course of Import into the territory of India shall also be deemed to be a supply of goods/services in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. The levy of IGST will be payable for each transaction, as against the monthly payment in case of IGST payable on domestic interstate transactions. The other difference in GST is aboput IGST computation. The IGST will be computed on transaction value of imported goods plus duties and taxes etc. charged under any statute other than the GST Law. Hence, ISGT will be applied on total landed value, basic customs duty and any other charges. On import of services GST will be based on reverse charge method just as the Service tax is today i.e. IGST will apply on reverse charge mechanism. Hence, all Software or a SaaS bought online will be subject to reverse charge basis IGST. But there is a input credit allowed in ISGT on imports. The service provider, trader or manufacturer of imported goods/services shall be eligible to offset IGST paid on import of goods/services against his output liability. The same does not apply to BCD as BCD is not part of GST. Although it does not apply to Software sector, the anti-dumping duties and safeguard duties will continue to be applied as they were and have not been subsumed in the IGST. Impact on exports Exports under GST will be Zero rated i.e. there will not be any exports duty except on items that enjoy an export duty levy currently. Software exports will be zero rated. The biggest impact will be on units presently enjoying exemptions on inputs like service tax in SEZ. Under GST all duties and taxes will be payable at the time of a transaction when procuring input goods/service and the exporter can get refund for these after exporting. Exemptions will be replaced by refunds after exports. This will put lot of burden on arranging working capital for the inputs. This burden will be higher for manufacturing firms than services firms. On pursuance of commerce ministry, in a recent announcement, the finance ministry has agreed to relax the refund pains. The finance ministry has agreed to refund 90% of the duties paid by exporters within a period of seven days under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. If duty refunds could not be made within seven days, then government will pay interest to exporters. However, it is yet to be decided how much interest will be paid to exporters in such a scenario, as per announcement. (Source: livemint news item ) The remaining 10% refund will be made after verification by tax authorities. This is a bit of relief to exporters. Compliance process will change from presently exemption based compliance to a refund claim filing in time. The crux here is to use digital technology to automate many of these issues in GSTN. Whereas these announcements have been made, the details will depend upon how rules are notified. GST will undoubtedly make the efficient in long run. However, the next one year will be full of challenges and adjustments by Ministry of finance to oversee a smooth rollout.

Goods and Service Tax - Impact on Imports / Exports / Foreign Trade Policy Submit New Article Discuss this article Goods and Service Tax - Impact on Imports / Exports / Foreign Trade Policy By: CS SANJAY MALHOTRA September 7, 2016 Contents Goods and Service Tax – “Impact on Foreign Trade Policy” Impact of Goods and Service Tax on Imports and Exports in India is the area which calls for review of various statutory compliances, IGST Rates, Export Benefits, Import Exemptions, Position of EOU in present Vs GST Regime, Supplies to SEZ/STPI/Mega Power Projects/Projects under ICB (International Competitive Bidding)...... Industry at large needs to review the Impact of GST on Imports from Working Capital perspective, Input / Capital Cost of Imports, Decision making, Imports Vs Indigenous sourcing........ In the present Indirect Tax structure, Central Taxes are refunded by either the office of Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Commerce, but the provisions under Model GST law seems to involve State also if the existing benefits under FTP 2015-20 continued, which has been discussed below in detail. Ministry of Commerce should take up with the Ministry of Finance and it is recommended to have members from DGFT also to be part of GST Council so that the provisions of FTP 2015-20 should be taken care of and suitably considered while drafting GST Bill. Royal Malaysian Customs GST on Imports can be referred to as a guide for formulating GST treatment in case of Imports. Utilisation of Duty Credit Scrip (MEIS/SEIS) Duty Credit Scrip is issued by the office of Regional DGFT at a specified % on FOB Value of Exports on the Notified products into Notified Markets. Chapter 3 of FTP 2015-20 (Para 3.02) provides for utilisation of Duty Credit Scrip for the payment of Central Taxes i.e. Excise Duty / Custom Duty / Service Tax / Composition fees / Import Duty against E.O. Defaults in case of IMPORTS & Domestic Sourcing of RM/Capital Goods. Duty Credit Scrip at present is utilised for payment of Excise Duty, Service Tax, Custom Duty, CVD, SAD on Indigenous and Imported Inputs/Capital Goods. The same is also used for payment of Duty payments against E.O. Defaults in Chapter 4 and 5 of FTP 2015-20 No Provision exists in the Model GST Law-2016 (Section 35) for the utilisation of Duty Scrip for the payment of GST in case of Indigenous sourcing or Imports or E.O. Defaults. The same should be reviewed and suitably incorporated in GST Law as one of the Mode of Payment of GST as in the absence of same, financial outflow will increase and the Duty Credit Scrip remain unutilised or accumulated with the Exporter. However as the Basic Custom Duty is out of GST, the Duty Scrip can be utilised towards payment of Basic Custom Duty, but nevertheless issue remains for payment of IGST in case of Imports or Indigenous sourcing. CENVAT Credit admissibility on Utilisation of Duty Credit Scrip Duty Credit Scrip utilised for payment of Excise Duty / Service tax is eligible for CENVAT Credit in the present Excise Law / FTP 2015-20 ( Para 3.15 of FTP ), whereas NOTHING has been specifically provided in Section 35 , Section 16 of Model GST Law and Section 8 of IGST Act for Credit of Input Tax. Transitional Provisions not aligned with FTP 2015-20 Transitional provisions have been defined under Model GST Law for carry forward of Input Tax credit on the appointed day, but NOTHING has been specified for Input Tax Credit in GST regime in respect of Duty Payments made from Duty Credit Scrip before the appointed date. Transitional provisions should be specified by the Office of DGFT (Ministry of Commerce) in alignment with the Model GST Law in respect of Imports cleared against Advance Authorisation / EPCG Schemes before the appointed date, but the material has been received after the appointed day. What would be the scenario if the Imports are duty paid under present regime i.e. CVD & SAD is paid on Imports???? Would the credit of CVD and SAD is available as IGST in the GST regime???? What would be the fate of CENVAT Credit of duties debited from Duty Credit Scrip against E.O. Defaults or regular Imports or Indigenous sourcing against Import Licences with Invalidation letter??? All the above needs to be considered and incorporated in GST Model Law so as to have continuity in business operations. Exempted Supplies to EOU/STPI/Mega Power Projects against Concessional Certificates At present Supplies to EOU/STPI/Mega Power Projects/World Bank Funded Projects / Projects under ICB are exempted from Central Taxes against CT-3/CT-1/Certificates from State Govt. or by way of Refund of Terminal Excise Duty / Duty Drawback. All supplies as stated above are subject to Tax in GST regime. In case of supplies to EOU, Refund of GST may be claimed either by the Supplier of goods or Recipient subject to some conditions. Nothing has been specified for supplies to STPI/Mega Power Projects / World Bank funded Projects as to the payment of GST and refund of same. In absence of clarity, these supplies would attract GST which adds to cost of product and may impact on sourcing from within India thus defeating the Make in India concept. What would be the GST Liability for Temporary Importation of Goods in India and sent back after repairs, reconditioning, testing or any other processes- Not defined in Model GST Law??????? What would be the treatment of GST in case of Import of material in India and transfer to Warehouse, which would be cleared for home consumption afterwards from Warehouse. GST is to be paid upon clearance of goods from warehouse but all these needs to be specified by GST Law. Supplies as stated above should be reviewed in the GST regime by MOF and MOC. Import of Inputs against Advance Authorisation / EPCG Scheme Imports are treated as Inter-State Purchase and are liable to IGST in GST Regime. Import of Inputs / Capital Goods are exempted from Import Duties if sourced under Advance Authorisation Scheme / EPCG Scheme subject to conditions to be fulfilled for Export of Products. In this, Importer saves on account of Cash Outflow and the Country stands to gain in terms of realisation of Free Foreign Currency. IGST will be substituted for CVD (Countervailing Duty) and SAD (Special Additional Duty). At present the CVD and SAD put together accounts for tax rate of nearly 17%, whereas GST rates may be 18-22%. Change in GST Rates may impact Export Obligation also. For e.g. in case of sourcing under Zero Duty EPCG Scheme, in majority of cases CVD (12.50%) and SAD (4%) thus put together amounts to 17% considering cascading impact. If IGST rates prevail around 20-22%, the same would also add to increase in Export Obligation and Importer may not have his business strategy to Import under Import schemes. In GST Regime, Imports of Inputs / Capital Goods should be exempted ab-initio from IGST or else the exemption of Basic Custom Duty and payment of IGST in cash would result in increased outflow of Working Capital thus leading to Increase in Transaction Cost. The above is to be taken on priority by MOF and MOC so that the Importers Cash flow should not be impacted and furthermore Exports should be sustained. Refund of Terminal Excise Duty in case of Supplies against Invalidation Letter for Inputs / Capital Goods Terminal Excise Duty leviable on sourcing against Advance Authorisation / EPCG with Invalidation letter is refunded at present (but not sales tax part), whereas in the GST Regime, CGST/SGST or IGST (Summation of SGST & CGST), would be refunded thus making the TED refund for state levies too. If the State Levies are refunded under Terminal Excise Refund by offices of DGFT in relation to above transactions, then Notifications to be issued under SGST also as is done by presently by MOF & MOC. (Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Commerce) Transitional Provisions should be specified for Import Duty Payment against E.O. Default against AA/EPCG or Suo- Moto. No provision of Input Tax credit under Model GST Law. Input Tax Credit should be allowed in GST for duty debited from Duty Credit scrip as IGST.

The industry was expecting for some amendments in the direction of smoother transition, however, the government has avoided immediate change management for businesses. India is one of the fastest growing global economy and in the way to becoming the new global manufacturing hub. While manufacturing activities are on rising, we are also witnessing expansion in foreign trade both imports and exports. We have previously covered the impact of Goods and Services Tax on the various set of industries including Logistics , Food and Restaurants , E-Commerce Marketplace Sellers to mention a few. Continuing our agenda, we are now extending our discussion on Impact of GST on Import and Importer’s Business. As per the Model GST Law, GST will subsume C ountervailing Duty(CVD) and Special Additional Duty (SAD) , however, Basic Customs Duty will continue to do its round in the import bills. BCD has been kept outside the purview of GST and will be charged as per the current law only. Impact of GST on Imports Below are some of the implications for imports and importers by virtue of GST implementation in India: Import as Inter-State Supply – Import into India will be considered as Inter-State supply under Model GST Law and accordingly will attract Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) along with BCD and other surcharges. Import of Services – Model GST law accord liability of payment of tax on the service receiver, if such services are provided by a person residing outside India. This is similar to the current provision of reverse charge, wherein service receiver is required to pay tax and file return. Transaction Value based Valuation Principal – Model GST law has borrowed the concept of transaction value based valuation principal from current customs law for charging GST. This will have implication at the time of tax liability determination as currently CVD is charged on MRP valuation principle. Under the new regime IGST which subsumes CVD will be charged on transaction value. This may also require working capital restructuring. This may also reveal the margin of Service Provider which is currently not the case. Refund of Duty – Under the new law, tax paid during import will be available as a credit under “Import and Sale” model, whereas no such credit is available presently. Also refund of SAD which is available now, after doing specific compliance, no such restrictions are placed under GST. Withdrawal of Current Exemptions – The current customs import tariff is loaded with multiple exemption notifications which are likely to reviewed and possibly withdrawn or converted into a refund mechanism. This could mean change in the structure of export-linked duty exemption schemes under the FTP where the duty exemptions may get limited to exemption from payment of BCD, while IGST may not be exempted. Withdrawal of exemptions or changing them to refund mechanism could fundamentally change the attractiveness and viability of some of the key schemes under the FTP like EOU, STP, Advance authorization etc. Explore more on GST by Clicking Here .

""However FIEO welcomes GST, but we are worried with the liquidity issue as the refund mechanism would require payment of GST first and its refund subsequently. The additional cost of credit to manage the liquidity should be borne by the Government, if present exemption is not brought forward in the GST. On a rough estimate, export sector would be losing export competitiveness by about 2% and the same needs to be off-setted to the export sector. This will impact SMEs more,"" FIEO President G K Gupta told reporters in New Delhi. In his address, Gupta said, ""The export sector welcomes the introduction of GST as its spin off effect would benefit both the manufacturing and export sector. The logistics cost is expected to come down to help the exim sector. The quick refund, as against delayed refund of VAT, will also help the export sector."" He also said that exporters welcome the final Refund Rules envisaging issuance of acknowledgment within 3 days of the filing of claim and issuance of 90 percent of the claim amount on provisional basis within 7 days, unfortunately contrary to general belief, the interest on delayed payment would be due only after 60 days. ""This will give a jolt to exporters particularly in micro & small sector. FIEO, therefore, request the Government to provide interest on delayed refund after 10 days (3 days + 7 days) instead of 60 days,"" he added. FIEO also suggested that exporters be allowed to pay GST on transactions through e-currency. The review of Foreign Trade Policy 2015-20 is due on 1st October, 2017. Gupta said, ""Since GST will be rolled out from 1st of July, 2017, FIEO has requested the Ministry of Commerce to prepone the announcement so as to coincide with the rolling out of GST. We are grateful to the Hon'ble Minister for agreeing to our request."" ""We also request the Government to sensitize the trade & industry that the imports duty benefit on imports under the existing instruments would only continue till the date of introduction of GST. All existing instruments will have to follow the discipline of the GST Act and the Rules from 1.7.2017,"" he added. FIEO has analysed India's exports in relation to Global imports at HS 6 digit level. It used the data for the years 2006, 2011 and 2016. FIEO focused on the Top 200 lines of world imports. These lines account for 58 percent of world imports and 50 percent of India's global exports. Data shows that India's top product basket is broadly in sync with global basket. FIEO Director General Ajay Sahay told media that though world trade is increasing, India's exports are not growing at that pace. He said, ""Our share in these 200 products is presently at 1.43 percent and an increase of share by 0.5 percent can add to over USD 80 billion in country's exports."" India's global share in top 200 products is only 1.43 percent and 1.62 percent in all products. ""We need to focus on exports of top 200 teriff lines,"" added Sahay.

Asit Ranjan Mishra The GST rate for all branded products including textiles and jewellery will be decided on 3 June. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint New Delhi: The commerce ministry fears that a higher than expected goods and services tax (GST) rate on gems and jewellery and textiles products may make such exports uncompetitive and exporters may have to be compensated. The two items are among six on which GST rates could not be finalized in the 14th GST council meeting in Srinagar last week and a decision was deferred for the next meeting on 3 June. “After GST rates are imposed, if the tax rates increases on textiles and gems and jewellery sectors, then we have to evaluate how much more support they may require, because the margins in the international market are fixed and higher taxes may make them uncompetitive,” a commerce ministry official said, speaking under condition of anonymity. Also Read: India is making its biggest tax reform far too complicated The official said there cannot be uniform rates for textiles and gems and jewellery items as the products vary widely. “For example handloom cannot be taxed on par with technical textiles as you need to encourage the labour intensive handloom sector. For handloom products, it should be zero,” the official said. At present, taxes on textile products vary from 4% to as high as 60%. Rahul Mehta, president of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India in a note posted on its website wrote that from all the informal feedback the association has received, government is likely to impose 12% GST rate on the sector. “It is a pity that the government has not considered the industry fit to be taxed at the lowest slab of 5%, which would have given a tremendous boost to the industry. However, I do hope that our recommendation that the entire industry be taxed uniformly is accepted; failing which there will be huge issues of compliance, if not total chaos,” he added. The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has demanded to fix GST rate at 1.25% for the sector with continuing exemptions for diamonds. The council, in a representation to the finance ministry, said the government should not let go the pre-eminent global position the industry has achieved by imposing a higher GST rate. At present, most of the jewellery items are taxed between 2.5-3% and differs from state to state. Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said in Srinagar that the state wants jewellery to be taxed at 5% against 1.5% that the industry has been demanding. Also Read: GST impact: Hold back price hikes till rollout, Hasmukh Adhia tells companies “Gold is a luxury product. It is not a necessity. Price of gold has quadrupled in the last one decade. Nobody had any problem. What is the big trouble with a 5% tax on jewellery. We are very reasonable people (at the Council). We will discuss,” said Isaac. The government has aligned most of the goods and services in the five slabs of taxation—5%, 12%, 18%, 28% and 28% plus cess. Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia in an interaction with CNBC TV18 said the GST rate for all branded products including textiles will be decided on 3 June. Though he said a final decision is yet to be taken on whether branded products should be treated differently from non-branded products, he suggested that manufacturers of branded products will benefit if a GST rate is imposed since they will be able to claim input credit.

Is Goods & Services Tax (GST) Simply Overrated? Logistics & Warehousing Goods and Services Tax a Panacea for all woes? Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in his element when he congratulated the country on the passage of the much-touted Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill in the Upper House of the Parliament, claiming that the new tax regime will rid the country of tax-terrorism. The tax regime which was proposed about a decade back as the panacea that would clean up the messy and complex indirect tax structure of the country, is expected to give India’s GDP a fillip, apart from boosting exports. “Expected” is the word. While GST has become popular as a ‘One Nation-One Tax’ formulation, the realities of implementation may be more complicated than political negotiations in the Parliament. Truth is GST, for which the ruling administration has set a go-live date of April 1, 2017, is in no way a one-tax rule. As things stand, the Centre has agreed to subsume excise duty, additional excise duty, service tax, countervailing duty, surcharge and cess, and central sales tax into the waiting arms of GST. The States have agreed to give up VAT (sales tax), entertainment tax, luxury tax, taxes on gambling, octroi and entry taxes, cess and purchase tax. GST will thus replace all of these taxes. The all-important tax rate though remains to be agreed upon. A wait of more than a decade came to an end on August 3, 2016, when the 122nd Constitution Amendment Bill, 2014 (popularly known as GST Bill) was passed by the Upper House of the Parliament of India. This is apparently the country’s biggest tax reform since Independence.Some achievement therefore for the Indian democracy. The new tax regime, which subsumes all indirect taxes such as sales tax and excise tax, is expected to bring down tax rates in India, while converting the country into a big single market. In short, now, seamless flow of goods and services will occur across 29 states and 7 union territories! Many believe the landmark Goods and Services Tax Bill (GST) passed by the two houses of the Parliament – after years of back and forth by the ruling party and main opposition (both the present ruling and main opposition parties have supported and opposed the Bill depending on whether they were in power or in the opposition) – is a key step that would catapult India into the big league in global supply chain. The implementation of the Bill is expected to ease India’s cumbersome tax system, help goods move seamlessly across state borders, curb tax evasion, improve compliance, increase revenues, spur growth, boost exports, and attract investments by improving ease of doing business in India. In short, GST when implemented, is expected to perform miracles. But, can it really? And considering that the Bill still needs to be ratified by at least 13 more state legislatures (over and above the three states Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand,which had already passed the bill, as on August 22, 2016) before the President of India can notify the GST Council to decide on the new tax rate and other issues with respect to GST, will it be a easy journey for the GST to the finish line? India is by no means the first country to experiment with a unified tax regime.160 countries already have some form of GST or a value added tax. What makes GST in India special is that as opposed to a federally administered regime, the Union and state governments will jointly administer India’s dual GST. This means it will be a set of many different taxes – a GST for each of the 29 states and two union territories (SGST), a Central GST (CGST), and an Integrated GST (IGST; which will be a combine of CGST and SGST on inter-state supplies of goods and services). That surely is not as unified as it seems. Interestingly, India will be one of the very few countries with a dual GST regime alongside Canada and Brazil. The all-important rate is yet to be finalised, with the final standard rate possibly lying between 15% to 27%, though 18% is the rate that seems to be gaining a sort of consensus amongst pundits. The problem though is that the pundits won’t decide the rate! GST rate will be decided in the coming months by a GST Council that will prise the Finance Minister with a representative from each state government. As such it will be negotiated amongst the Union and state governments that will jointly administer the GST regime. It will still remain complex and difficult to implement, but would surely make life easier for businesses by cutting down, or rather combining, the many indirect taxes that companies file in India. Foreign media has called GST one of the world’s most complex tax reforms that needs to be supported and serviced by state-of-the-art technology. And Infosys, the Indian software giant, has already started building a massive electronic infrastructure – a GST portal (GSTP) – where taxpayers can register, make payments and file returns. It is expected that some 7.5 million businesses will be covered by the tax. But then there are several questions that have been doing rounds since the day the Bill was passed in Rajya Sabha. What will really be the impact of GST on India’s manufacturing and service sectors? What will be a realistic timeframe for its implementation? How difficult will the implementation process be given the dual nature? What would be an ideal timeframe by which benefits will be realised? And above all, what will be the impact on exports from key sectors? The long queues of goods carriers at checkpoints should become a thing of the past with the implementation of GST. In India, trucks, according to some estimates, on an average, spend 48 hours per trip at various check-posts. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) BUSINESS MADE EASY One factor where the industry has clearly been in consensus is that GST being a destination based tax (where the tax is not applied at the point of production but at the point of supply or consumption),will make life easier for businesses in India. Companies will not have to file tax returns with multiple departments, but there will be just one web-based form to file tax returns. The country will finally become one common market, with uniform pricing across states, and optimal allocation of resources, making our goods more competitive. “Undoubtedly the most significant reform since the liberalisation in 1991, GST will transform India’s economic landscape. Unifying the $2 trillion economy and its 1.3 billion people under a uniform tax code, makes our country one of the most attractive destinations for business. I am confident that this game-changing legislation will propel India into a $20 trillion economy in the decades to come,” says Anil Agarwal, Chairman, Vedanta Group. Apart from this, there will be a very strong positive impact on the logistics sector. There is no one in India who has not seen the serpentine queues of goods carrying vehicles standing at inter-state check posts for inspection and payment of taxes. Even Shaktikanta Das, Economic Affairs Secretary, Ministry of Finance, GoI, is on record saying that trucks on an average spend 48 hours stranded at different check-posts every trip. The GST in ‘one fell swoop’ will remove these barriers, thus making India a preferred destination for business. “GST will revolutionise logistics with unified and simplified structure versus multiple taxes at various levels. It will lower the inventories and working capital, reduce documentation, improve asset utilisation, ensure higher turnaround time and efficiencies. We expect the industry to move away from pure vanilla warehousing needs to contract logistics,” Prakash Tulsiani, Executive Director & COO, Allcargo Logistics, tells The Dollar Business. EASE OF DOING BUSINESS, A REALITY! CENTRAL TAXES SUBSUMED UNDER GST Central Excise Duty (including additional excise duties) Service Tax Additional Customs Duty (CVD) Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD) Central Sales Tax and cesses STATE GOVERNMENT TAXES SUBSUMED UNDER GST Value Added Tax Sales Tax Octroi and Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling State cesses and surcharges Entertainment Tax IMPACT OF GST ON BUSINESSES Sourcing : Inter-state procurement will become easier;Manufacturers get the option of consolidating supplies from vendors;Additional Duty/CVD and Special Additional Duty components of Customs Duty to be subsumed. Distribution : The new regime will allow consolidation and optimisation of warehouses;Current arrangements for distribution of finished goods to change;Current network structure and product flows may need review and possible alteration because of removal of Excise Duty. Pricing and profitability : Tax changes resulting from the GST structure would require repricing of Products. Prices could both increase or decrease; Margins or price mark-ups would also need to be re-examined. Cash flow: Removal of the concept of Excise Duty on manufacturing can result in improvement in cash flows and inventory costs as GST would now be paid at the time of sale/supply rather than at the time or removal of goods from the factory. System changes and transaction management: Potential changes to accounting and IT systems in areas of master data, supply chain transactions, system design;Existing open transactions and balances as on the cut-off date need to be migrated out to ensure smooth transition to GST;Changes to supply chain reports (e.g., purchase register, sales register,services register), other tax reports and forms (e.g., invoices,purchase orders) need review;Appropriate measures such as training of employees, compliance under GST, customer education and tracking of inventory credit are needed to ensure smooth transition to the GST regime. DUAL-GST: WHO GETS WHAT TRANSACTION NEW SYSTEM OLD SYSTEM COMMENTS Sales within the state State GST & Central GST VAT & Excise / ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale within the state shall attract two taxes: SGST (which goes to the State), and CGST (which goes to the Centre) Sales outside the state Integrated GST CST & Excise / ST Under the new system, a transaction of sale from one state to another shall have only one type of tax, the IGST – which is collected by the Centre NOT SO EASY Sounds good. But then it won’t be an easy run to the finish line for GST. And the reason is simple! The dual nature of India’s GST regime is expected to make implementation a complex problem, and rob off some of the key features of ease of doing business. Canada and Brazil, both have a federal administrative structure similar to that of India and have opted for the dual GST route. For instance in Canada, the dual GST route obviously cleared up the conflict between states and the Union government in terms of revenue generation and tax collection, and allowed for a consensus to be formed. But then, Canada owing to the dual nature of its GST has not been able to unify the nation as a common market, with different taxes in different provinces still in effect. In India, though the scrapping of the proposed additional 1% inter-state tax has cleared the air considerably making businesses happy, the states still need to agree on a common rate. And while states like West Bengal and Bihar will be happy with a low tax rate, many like Tamil Nadu are expected to ask for a much higher rate. At the high-end, some states have even asked for a GST rate of 27%. But then, experts believe, a tax rate that high can completely negate the positive effects of GST. “The current combined Centre and state statutory rate for majority of the commodities works out to be 26.5% (CENVAT : 14%, and VAT: 12.5%). Once GST is implemented, the same is expected to reduce to a standard rate to about 18-21%. This will naturally be beneficial for the end users. But if the tax rate goes beyond 18-21%, a lot of the benefits of GST will be lost,” says Harpreet Singh Malhotra, Chairman & Managing Director, Tiger Logistics. And then there is the issue of tax refunds from state governments, with some states known to be tardy with refunds. Rakesh Shah, Director, Nipha Group, a Kolkata-based exporter of engineering goods, while speaking to The Dollar Business on the dual-GST sytem says, “This is the biggest drawback of the GST regime from our perspective. Some state governments do not have a great track record of refunding taxes and there is nothing in GST so far that makes us believe that they will change their behaviours.” There is another fear – inflation. THE INFLATION BOOGIE The proposed tax regime has raised fears of inflation at a time when CPI has shot up beyond the official tolerance level of 6%. Outgoing RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan has cautioned the industry that there could be a generalised inflationary effect on the economy due to price adjustments after implementation of GST. However, the Governor has also clarified that he expects the inflationary pressure to be negligible. Citing the example of Malaysia, he said that the inflation in Malaysia was both negligible and short-lived and this is expected in India as well due to a one-time price adjustment of goods and services. Potential inflation will depend significantly on the final rate of GST and the basket of goods and services that will be exempt from GST. Meanwhile, RBI Deputy Governor Urjit Patel has pointed out that about 55% of the items that form the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be exempt from GST, making the inflationary impact negligible. Even a Nomura report estimates GST to impact headline CPI inflation by just 20-70 basis points (bps) and core CPI by 10-40 bps in the first year of implementation. And that would exbe on account of higher prices of electricity, clothing and footwear, healthcare, medicine, and education after accounting for input taxes. Food items like cereals and vegetables are expected to become more expensive. Essential items like health services and medicines will also become expensive as they presently are subjected to lower tax rates, even if GST rate is capped at 18%.As of now, products like alcohol and petroleum have been kept out the GST ambit; clarity is yet to emerge on whether there will be more exemptions. With various industry bodies lobbying for exemptions or lower rates, it is plausible that we will see more products and services being exempted. That being said, in the past, countries (like Malaysia and New Zealand) which have opted for GST have been known to face high inflation and slowdown in consumption initially.Whether history will be repeated in India depends on a host of factors, the most important being the standard rate of GST finally agreed upon. EXPORTS TO CLIMB? If GST improves ease of doing business, can exports be far behind? With uniform taxation and cost efficiencies owing to reduced time and costs in transportation, one obvious effect would be that ‘Made in India’ products would now be more cost competitive in the global markets. “In the previous tax regime, our exbe ports were sagging, since we also exported a major portion of taxes. Indigenous manufacturers failed to capitalise owing to double taxation. All this will change post GST. And eventually exports from the country will increase,” says Nihal Kothari, Chairman, National Council on Indirect Taxes, ASSOCHAM and Executive Director at Khaitan & Co. And he is right! We have examples of GST boosting an economy’s exports. For instance, New Zealand implemented GST in CY1986 and saw it exports jump from $5,880 million in CY1986 to $7,195 million CY1987, a growth of 22.36%. Similar was the case with Australia, which implemented GST regime in CY2000. Australia’s exports grew at a CAGR of 7.9% from $63,870 million in CY2000 to $86,565 million in CY2004.The present system of differential multiple tax regimes across sectors of production and locations leads to distortions in allocation of resources as well as supply chain and warehouse structuring. There is a tendency of manufacturers to locate manufacturing facilities as well as warehouses in states or locations that offer better tax structures regardless of their suitability in terms of other resources. With regard to India’s exports, this leads to lack of international competitiveness of the sectors which would have been relatively efficient under distortion-free indirect tax regime. Add to this, there is a lack of full offsets of taxes loaded on to the FOB (Free On Board) export prices. This results in export competitiveness further getting negatively impacted. Efficient allocation of productive resources and providing full tax offsets, as envisaged under the GST, is therefore expected to result in gains for exporters. According to a paper on GST by the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) submitted to the 13th Finance Commission, gains in exports are expected to vary between 3.2% and 6.3% (while imports are expected to rise somewhere between 2.4% and 4.7%). Sectors which are expected to see a substantial increase in exports include textiles and readymade garments, beverages, industrial machinery for food and textiles, transport equipment other than railway equipment, electrical and electronic machinery, and chemical products. Further, while agricultural machinery, metals and railway transport equipment are expected to gain moderately, exports is expected to decline when it comes to agricultural commodities, iron and steel, cement, wood and wood products except furniture. GST will provide the much-needed boost to India’s automotive industry, primarily because of the removal of cascading that is expected with the new tax regime. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) FATE OF FTP SCHEMES A mixed bag of good and bad news could therefore be on offer for India’s exporters.And it will be that way with some sectors emerging as winners, while others losing out on a few advantages. However, what can be a bigger cause of worry for exporters is the ambiguity with respect to various export promotion schemes allowed by India’s Foreign Trade Policy (like MEIS, SEIS, EPCG, DBK, Advance Authorisation, etc.) during the initial GST implementation phase. Exporters are allowed to claim refunds on Central Excise, Customs duties and Service Tax against various scrips issued by the Ministry of Commerce. Since Central Excise and Service Tax will be subsumed under GST, exporters may face problems in encashing the much-needed incentives that have been structured to support exports.Asks Shah of Nipha Group, “Exports are zero rated, but GST retains the refund system at the final stage which will mean increased blockage of funds. A number of current export promotion schemes will wither away or get diluted. Similarly, what will happen to our dues during the transition from the current system to GST? How will they be treated?” Office of the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), Ministry of Commerce, GoI, is aware of the issue. D. K. Singh, Additional DGFT, while speaking to The Dollar Business says, “Under the current system, one can pay Customs Duty, Central Excise Duty and Service Tax. But, since Central Excise will be replaced by other taxes such as IGST and SGST under GST, it may not be a smooth transition for our exporters. So, we have requested the Finance Ministry to reconsider and allow us to maintain the scrip.” As per him, the matter is currently under examination by the Ministry of Finance. The current indirect tax regime provides for lower or no Customs Duty on imports for importers who use those imports in producing goods that are subsequently exported. However, under GST, imports would be subject to IGST (CGST plus SGST) and any exemptions or additional levy will not exist. This would provide level-playing field to domestic manufacturers against importers. In case of special economic zone (SEZs), the various exemptions provided under different schemes would be limited in their applicability to export duty only. Exports or deemed exports would be zero rated, but sale to domestic tariff area (DTA) would be taxable. Exports from these special zones though will get a leg-up by being more cost competitive, owing to reduced logistics costs. ON THE FAST LANE GST has the potential to revolutionise the logistics industry. India’s trucking and logistics sector will realise its worth once GST is implemented at the ground level. Experts believe that the tax procedure will get reduced dramatically and the cost of holding inventory will fall by 50%, since stock would no longer need to be piled up in various warehouses. Analysts estimate that the logistics sector will witness up to $200 billion in savings annually with GST, thanks to faster movement of goods and minimum idling, which have troubled the industry for long now. Explaining the issue of idling, Harpreet Singh Malhotra, CMD, Tiger Logistics says, “Prolonged delays at toll booths and extra fuel usage due to regular idling were resulting in annual losses of more than Rs.1,00,000 crore. Such delays don’t just burn money, they slow down business too.” According to Malhotra, while trucks in US are said to cover a distance of 800 km every day, in India they cover only 280 km a day. There is no surprise in the fact, because where average US truck speeds exceed 89 kmper hour on highways, 12.7 km per hour is considered good as long-distance average in India. “Once GST gets going, these challenges will become a thing of the past,” adds Ramesh Agarwal, CMD, Agarwal Movers Group. According to logistics experts, the Indian logistics industry spends around 14% of the GDP every year on different types of cost incurred in logistics operations.The amount of cost incurred is very high in comparison to the logistics cost incurred in different nations. This scenario is expected to change once GST is in place. In fact, 3PL logistics market in India is expected to be worth $301.89 billion by 2020. This growth is based on expectations that GST will soon be implemented and logistics companies can optimise their operations to reduce cost and increase margins. RAVI RAMU MD & CEO,VBHC Value Homes “Affordable housing requires an ease of doing business for both the builder and the buyer. GST is a giant leap in this direction. We are delighted at the prospect of dealing with easily understood and implementable indirect tax laws. The marginally higher incidence of indirect taxes through the introduction of GST, if any, will be more than compensated for by the savings in time and effort in operating a far simpler law.” “GST will convert a diversified tax regime into one uniform tax rate making India a single market place. This would facilitate seamless transportation of goods across borders with a significantly lower transit time, thereby stepping up demand for logistics services.The GST Bill will also lead to higher vehicle capacity utilisation resulting in increased efficiencies at every node of the logistics ecosystem. Overall, this is a positive move that will generate growth opportunities for organised players within the logistics industry,” says Abhishek Chakraborty, Executive Director, DTDC Express Limited. Apart from simplifying the tax structure, GST will bring in huge relief to several players at the operational level as they can now do away with fixed costs of maintaining warehousing across various locations in India. “The fixed warehousing overheads of companies across industries will decrease by 30-32% and that will make them more competitive in the international market. Portable and virtual warehousing will become a viable option for many companies. It will also enhance their operational efficiency,” says Agarwal of Agarwal Movers Group. Although various logistics players and experts are expecting a short-term inflationary impact on exports, consensus is that GST will, in the long run, increase competitiveness of Indian exporters. IN AN AUTO MODE India’s automobile exports contracted 9.7% during the first quarter of this fiscal, with shipments of three-wheelers nose-diving as much as 46.6%. Last year, however, overall exports from the sector grew marginally at 1.91% over the previous fiscal, with commercial vehicle segment leading the exports growth. Come today, the automobile industry seems to be thrilled with the notion of a simplified tax regime. “The current tax structure on automobiles is riddled with complexities,” says Vivek Mishra, Partner & National Leader – Indirect Tax, PricewaterhouseCoopers. HOW GST WILL WORK: AN EXAMPLE (SMALL CAR) CURRENT GST Manufactures’ price (Rs.) 3,00,000 3,00,000 Total taxes at manufacturing stage (*includes excise duty, infra cess, VAT, octroi) 1,41,690 (47.23% total tax)* 54,000 (18% GST) Cost to dealers 4,41,690 3,54,000 Margin @10% 44169 35,400 Sale price for dealers 4,85,859 3,89,400 VAT/GST 60732 (12.5%) 70,092 (18%) Net VAT/GST (after claiming credit) 12,558 16,092 Price to retail customers 5,46,590 4,59,493 Currently, automobile sales are subject to six different types of tax at various rates which include Excise Duty, Infrastructure Cess, Octroi, VAT, Motor Vehicle Tax/Road Tax and Tax Collected at Source (TCS). What’s more? The variation in each of these tax rates, according to vehicle type, engine size and ground clearance, further compounds complexities. GST, once implemented, will remove the cascading effect of taxes and put Indian automobile industry on a stronger growth trajectory. All taxes on input paid will also be offset with the output liability of GST. Owing to different types of indirect taxes collected by the Centre and States separately, taxes paid on some of the input costs currently cannot be set-off against the final tax. Some of the common examples include Service Tax paid on certain inputs such as rent, IT, freight, etc., and lower tax credit on outsourcing activities, etc. This is likely to change once GST is implemented. Further, since CST will be subsumed in GST, manufacturers will no longer be required to have warehouses at multiple locations across states. The 2% CST, which currently is a cost to the manufacturer, will become a part of IGST, and the manufacturers will not be liable to pay this origin tax. Under the current regime, Excise Duty on vehicles is categorised into four slabs, in which smallest duty is applicable on smaller cars. But within the GST framework, taxes levied by the Central government such as Excise Duty and by state governments as Sales Tax would be subsumed into one tax uniform tax. If the proposed tax rate of 18-20% is approved, the prices of vehicle are expected to decrease by almost 8-18%, and a reduction in automobile cost structure will not only fuel demand for automobiles in the domestic market but will also make India-made vehicles more cost-competitive in export markets. The industry expects a dual tax structure for small and big cars to be announced when the government is ready with the final GST laws. “According to a report by the Committee on Economic Affairs, the proposed GST rate on SUVs is 40%. Therefore, SUV prices may increase slightly. But for all other cars, there will be a significant reduction in rates,” says Mishra. The current indirect tax provision categorises cars into four segments, with all attracting different sets of tax rates. While small cars (less than 1200 cc) attract a total of 27.6% tax (Excise Duty 12.50% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%), medium cars (1200 cc – 1500 cc) attract 39.1% tax (Excise Duty 24% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%). Luxury cars (beyond 1500 cc) and SUVs (also beyond 1500 cc), on the other hand, attract 42.1% (Excise 27% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%) and 45.1% (Excise Duty 30% + Cess 1.1 % + VAT 14%) respectively. Therefore, cars manufacturers end up paying tax in the rage of 27.6% (minimum) to 45.1% (maximum). If the proposed GST rate of 18-20% is accepted, small as well as big cars, excluding SUVs for which 40% rate has been discussed, will become cheaper and fuel the growth of the auto industry. While the automobile industry is betting big on the new indirect tax regime, it has apprehensions over the tax rate. How will the new rates be decided? Will there be a uniform rate for all size of cars? Will they all fall under the same 18-20% tax rate bracket? The question seems to be more about whether the government will decide rates based on efficiency or the capacity of cars. Nevertheless, if the industry’s predictions are anything to go by, automobile exports will be a major gainer from the new tax arrangement. The GST will help relax the burden of double taxation, unravel complexities and enhance ease of doing business for export-oriented automobile manufacturing hubs. However, the major challenge for the exporters will be to effectively manage their cash flow amid this shift from an exemption-based tax system to a refund-based system. The GST system would also encourage Indian vehicle manufacturers to produce cars of international standards. Under the current regime, a manufacturer has to comply with a labyrinth of taxes, which act as huge hurdles and add costs at each stage. Foreign investors are reluctant to invest in India, primarily becauseof the country’s regulatory and bureaucratic complexities. In the absence of GST, not only Indian car-makers but foreign too have to waste energy in their operations. A successful enactment of the new indirect tax regime would have a transformative effect on FDI in India. GST will also lessen overall production cost and hassles, thereby encouraging domestic as well as international car manufacturers to expand their businesses and make Indian products more qualitative and competitive across the world.A very similar situation is applicable to the engineering and capital goods manufacturing sectors. VINEET BAID CEO, Falcon Autotech “It is certain for businesses to welcome the GST Constitutional Amendment Bill. Businesses will now re-design the supply chains for removing the taxation bias from the supply chain design.This reshaping of supply chains by other sectors is set to favour the logistics sector by thus creating multiple opportunities. Consequently, we anticipate a sharp increase in the demand for warehouse automation, larger warehouses, high tonnage trucks and logistics management software. Supply chain consultants will see high demand for network planning and optimisation projects.Overall, we are expecting to see organized warehousing to witness significant upsurge.” ENGINEERED SUCCESS According to a Care Ratings report, “the complexity in the Engineering Goods sector is that companies are involved simultaneously in manufacturing of goods and rendering of services. For example, a company engaged in manufacturing of transmission towers also does EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction Services) of entire transmission lines which not only involves manufacturing of transmission towers but supply of bought out items and rendering of services. The EPC players pay service tax at present while the manufacturers pay excise duty. Introduction of GST is expected to improve the prospects of engineering, capital goods and power equipment (ECPE) sector by simplifying the tax structure.” And not to say the industry too has embraced the GST regime with both hands and hopes that it will transform the sector. Arvinder Pal Singh, Owner of Perfect Vibrator Company, a Delhi-based manufacturer of construction machinery parts, says, “GST is good for our industry. GST needs to be implemented as there would be a common tax. If there is one tax system, it will help in setting up the company anywhere in the country and also facilitates ease of doing business.” B. Ashok Rao of Rajeev & Co, manufacturer and exporter of ball valves, holds similar views. “GST will help in bringing down the cost of production in manufacturing of goods. The major advantage is that it facilitates inter-state trading which was earlier quite cumbersome due to various levies at different levels and in different states.” Players in the engineering sector are proposing that the tax rate under GST regime should be kept at a minimum level as it will result in lowering the final cost of products. “Tax rate should be 18% as it will benefit the industry in keeping the cost of production low and in turn passing the benefit to customers in form of lower-priced product. The proposed 22-25% tax structure would be too high for the industry,” says Singh. Rao also supports the 18% tax rate adding that “there is no direct benefit of GST on exports but lower costs at manufacturing level can automatically promote trade at both national as well as international levels.” The engineering sector, being the largest of the industrial sectors in India, is of strategic importance to the economy owing to its strong integration with other sectors. And as such it plays a pivotal role in the development of other industrial sectors of the economy. In fact, today, engineering sector accounts for about a quarter of the total factories and more than half of the overall foreign collaborations in the country. Hence, the proposed tax rate and structure under GST for the industry should be such that it avoids procedural difficulties for exporters and make their products competitive in export markets. “Instead of first paying the taxes and then claiming credit for the same, the proposed enabling GST law should exempt exporters from the taxation net since the country does not want to export taxes,” says T. S. Bhasin, Chairman, Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC). As per Bhasin, the turnaround time for tax return processing needs to be sped up tremendously. “Even if we consider six months on average, engineering goods companies will require a huge additional working capital,” he says. Further, post GST, buyers too will have to ensure that their vendors have robust IT infrastructure and compliance process in place, so that vendors do not default on timely and appropriate payment of taxes. RIGHT MEDICINE When it comes to pharmaceuticals sector, another key foreign exchange earner for the country, the reaction to the passage of the Bill has been mostly positive.GST will not only simplify tax structure, but will also create a level-playing field for Indian pharmaceutical companies vis-à-vis foreign competition. “The biggest advantage to the industry would be that of reduction in transaction cost, with an immediate impact coming from the discontinuance of CST. The multistage taxation along with the inability to take full benefit of the CENVAT credit / refund has been an issue for the industry. With central GST expected to be a single rate for goods and services, going forward credit accumulation may not be an area of concern,” states the report from Care Ratings. Furthermore, if the legislation provides for carrying forward of the unutilised credit this would be an additional boost to the industry. However, there are concerns about drug prices, exemptions and compliance procedures. Some analysts have warned that there could be a mild inflationary impact of GST on prices of medicines over the next one-two years. “Currently, medicines are taxed at 5% to 7.5%, depending on the state they are being sold. Post GST, our tax liability will increase to 12%. This will put further financial burden on our customers,” believes Rahul Thakral, MD, Biotic Healthcare. Terming inverted duty structure “the biggest challenge” for the sector, Kanchana T. K., Director General, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI), says, “inputs are taxed at 12.5% currently, while finished formulations are taxed at 6% from a Central Excise Duty standpoint. The difference is accumulated as a value-added tax credit (CENVAT), but no provision exists for refunds against accumulated CENVAT credits. The process of getting refunds under state VAT rules (where they exist) is also a long one.” However, suggesting a way out, Kanchana adds, “Specifically notifying the pharmaceutical industry under the model GST law and making the process of refund easier by automating it, would make a huge difference to drug manufacturers.” Well, a big first step in this direction is the provision in the draft GST which allows refunds in cases where the GST rate on inputs is higher than the GST rate on outputs. Some industry experts even forecast a possibility of negative impact on pharma sector if rate exceeds 12% because, as per them, the impact on pharma is largely rate-dependent. Similar concerns are echoed by Thakral of Biotic Healthcare who envisage a rate range hovering somewhere between 10-12% to be optimal. “Anything beyond, will negatively impact pharma industry,” he says. NO SHINY GEM FOR ALL Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his speech post passage of the Bill in Parliament, described GST as one more pearl in India’s necklace. The metaphor may be apt when it comes to overall tax reforms, but India’s gems and jewellery industry is, however, circumspect about GST’s glitter. Almost all major stakeholders in the exports segment want the government to levy the minimum possible tax rate on the industry under GST. The concept of Revenue Neutral Rate (RNR, a tax rate that allows the government to receive the same amount of money despite of changes in tax laws) is at the heart of the debate on calculating ATUL BANSHAL President, Finance and Accounts, M3M Group GST appears to be a benefactor for the real estate regime, primarily in light of the expected free flow of credit, which should translate into an increase in margins in the hands of the developer. Seamless and uniform transaction across states will help in cost rationalisation. GST should have a significant impact for commercial property developers, who today are burdened with high costs in absence of credit availability on construction services used for developing a to-be-rented commercial property. It is expected that under the GST regime, there should be a smooth flow of credit and current restriction on construction related credits not being available for offset is expected to be removed. This would help reduce the project costs in the hands of the developer, which should further have a positive effect on rentals. If the credit restrictions continue, due to higher GST rates, the project cost are only going to get escalated further. Besides, it also appears beneficial to end-user or buyers. Uniformity in taxes will help the buyers as well. In the current scenario, several taxes are added up in the cost posing a great difficulty for an ordinary buyer. Implementation of GST will lead to uniformity in taxation rescuing an ordinary buyer from calculation traps designed by the statute. the acceptable and feasible GST rate for the gems and jewellery industry and other industries for that matter. In fact, the government had published a report on RNR and the structure of rates for GST, prepared by a committee chaired by Chief Economic Advisor Dr.Arvind Subramanian in December 2015. A survey was then carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation, based on the report. The survey found that the tax structure for the gems and jewellery industry had been formulated at a ubsidised rate and, as a result of that, other industries are paying a price. In a nutshell, the survey findings were not in favour of the gems and jewellery industry. And the chances are high that incidence of tax on the industry will increase once GST is implemented. Well, the industry is crying fowl over the findings! According to Sanjeev Agarwal, CEO, Gitanjali Exports, one of the key objectives of the survey was to ascertain luxury and non-luxury product categories and, unfortunately, while doing so, the survey categorised gold as a luxury product. “In my opinion, the analysis is flawed for some obvious reasons. For instance, there is a possibility that households with low or no literacy level might not have understood the significance of the survey and ended up providing inaccurate gold investment details which might have had an adverse effect on the outcome of the survey,” says Agarwal. For telecom companies, the incidence of taxes will increase post-GST. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) Moreover, as per Agarwal, the survey didn’t differentiate between rural households and households that are dependent on the agrarian economy. “The distinction is crucial given the fact that agrarian economy enjoys substantial tax benefits,” says Agarwal. In fact, a huge share of earnings in the agrarian sector is beyond the ambit of tax-net. In addition, the penetration is gold is higher than the penetration of bank savings account in the country, which inevitably, makes gold, an unofficial currency in the rural areas. So, the survey inference that says that gold is being heavily subsidized and benefits are accrued to the rich and wealthy is inappropriate, feel industry insiders. In fact, the industry is unequivocal in its demand that GST should be levied at the lower slab. Gems and Jewellery Exports Promotion Council (GJEPC) has already submitted a preliminary report prepared by a Mumbai-based law firm, Economic Law Practice (ELP), after gathering feedback from various manufacturing segments of the industry like plain gold, diamonds and coloured gemstones. “Our key concerns are that supply and manufacturing side should not be overburdened with taxes, and getting tax input credit refund should be smooth. Above all, our exports should remain competitive, given the current global scenario,” says Sabyasachi Ray, Executive Director, GJEPC. One shouldn’t forget that there are past instances of higher tax structures proving detrimental to the country in more ways than one. For instance, the 10% import duty on gold, although succeeded in reducing gold import through official channel, it has also encouraged smuggling of gold inadvertently. According to various estimates, almost 200 tonne of gold worth Rs.60,000 crore is smuggled into the country every year. WEAVING MAGIC? Textile is another industry on which GST might have a negative impact. While the final GST rates are yet to be announced, even at the 12% lower rate recommended by the Dr. Arvind Subramanian Committee, the textile sector is likely to be negatively impacted. In fact, the cotton value chain is likely to be the worst affected as it is currently attracting zero Central Excise Duty. What’s more? Industry rating agency ICRA expects that “due to reduced tax advantage of cotton yarn vis-a-vis manmade yarn, there can be a gradual shift in the domestic textile industry towards manmade fibre.” For the uninitiated, India currently operates with a fibre mix of cotton: manmade of 60:40, as against global average ofof 40:60. “However, the degree of impact will depend on the final rates which will be applicable to the sector,” states the report. But then, there are some positives as well. “GST will give a fillip to the outsourcing processes in textile industry. It will translate to administrative ease and can help in significantly curtailing discrepancies and aberrations in the taxation system. Corruption and black money laundering will also be curbed,” says K. K. Lalpuria, Executive Director, Indo Count Industries Ltd., a company engaged in the manufacturing and export of cotton yarn, grey knitted fabrics and cotton made ups. Further, with input tax credit chain becoming more transparent and integrated, the tax credit for exporters will become easier and full credit of indirect taxes can be claimed. But at the same time, the Duty Drawback scheme, which aims to provide credit of indirect taxes, will lose relevance under GST. While export products, where the current duty drawback rates are lower than the incidence on indirect taxes on inputs, will benefit under GST, sectors, where drawback rates are higher, will take a hit in profitability. NOT BANKING ON GST One sector that has viewed GST skeptically is the services sector. “There could be a decrease in consumption of services as the service tax will move northward from the current rate of 15%,” says Saravana Kumar, Chief Investment Officer, LIC Nomura Mutual Fund. For instance, tax rates for telecom service providers could move up to 18-22% from the current 15%, resulting a dip in profits. This increased tax could also pinch consumers at the bottom of the pyramid. Further, GST is also being viewed by some as a “landmine of compliance”.Service providers will have to file over 30 returns every month based on their operations and geographic spread. There could also be issues on bringing credits under IGST. A case in point could be a transaction involving a Mumbai resident using Vodafone telecom services travelling to Bengaluru and making calls through an Aircel network. It remains difficult to determine and calculate the importer and supplier in such complicated transactions. Telecom service providers could also have challenges defining interchange costs (the amount that a telco pays a receiving network), besides finding it restrictive to market free and bundled services. The GST Bill is also leading CFOs of banks and financial corporations to ponder on the nature of business and areas that could be potentially hit. “For banks, the challenge could be further complicated as they may be construed as e-com operators for facilitating supply of services or goods through an electronic platform. This will result in an added obligation to collect tax at source. Under the present regime, there already exists litigation on whether banks or NBFCs are liable to pay taxes as dealers,” says Nihal Kothari, Chairman – National Council of Indirect Taxes, ASSOCHAM. Even IT companies are wary of the GST. Some feel the proposed tax regime could lower the competitiveness of India’s IT sector. “Companies engaged in the supply of services on a pan-India basis, will have to seek registrations in 37 jurisdictions. Complex billing and invoicing requirements due to place of supply and valuation will hit the service sector hard in general and IT in particular,” says R. Chandrashekha, President, National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom). HURDLES GALORE Well, GST comes with its own set of challenges. For most companies, overhauling the entire IT systems is the biggest challenge and this process could take anything between 6 to 9 months. While the government issued the first draft model GST law over a month ago, further details are awaited on aspects relating to compliance such as invoice formats and return details. “We anticipate several teething problems in transitioning to the GST regime. In the initial months, we anticipate that a parallel system for undertaking compliance will be required. The complexities are far more for services companies, where a lot of ground needs to be covered to get clarity on taxation of pan India contracts involving multiple states,” says Mahesh Jaising, Partner, BMR & Associates LLP, a tax advisory firm. Companies are even hiring experts to help them make a smooth transition from current tax regime to GST. For instance, FMCG major Emami has hired PricewaterhouseCoopers to assess the impact of GST regime on the company and chart a roadmap to realign company’s strategy accordingly. “Migrations from current regime to GSTN (Goods and Services Tax Network) will start from October 1, 2016,” says L. Badri Narayanan, Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan. Narayanan’s firm is an advisor to Infosys, the system integrator in the GST project. He shares that most suppliers’ data will be transitioned from Excise, Central Sales and VAT to GSTN, however, suppliers will have to request for registration for migrating to ISD (Input Service Distributor). WHILE THE BILL HAS BEEN EMBRACED, ITS SUCCESS WILL BE DEFINED BY ITS IMPLEMENTATION While most legal experts sound optimistic that the system will be operational by end of 2017, industry and technology experts opine that building a system from legacy could have potential barriers. Narayanan is hopeful that the GST network will be ready and operational by April 1, 2017, but the transition period could result in working capital issues for traders. “A trader is neither manufacturing nor providing services, and if he is not eligible for CENVAT credit within the old regime he will not be entitled to CENVAT credit on duty paid which he earlier received,” he explains. A major change involving GST implementation is its compliance, which will necessitate robust systems and tracking of information. Since the entire process of tax has been revamped, the process of accounting and auditing will also undergo a change. Much of this change will occur on the systems that organisations use for compliance. “Entire ERP systems will need to be re-configured, and staff will have to be trained on GST aspects. The onboarding of vendors could result in a big change. There is need of support from finance, procurement, legal, IT, and many other departments for positive outcome of GST, else the holistic picture may not be possible,” says Pratik Shah, Partner, SKP Business Consulting LLP. As manufacturing becomes advantageous, organisations will be motivated to manufacture commodities themselves rather than procuring them. For service organisations, they will be compelled to think on operating back-office centres themselves. On the positive side, from the government’s perspective, GST systems across the globe have improved compliance, and in many-an-instance we’ve seen even a revenue neutral rate turning into revenue positive due to an expanded tax base. Thus far, Indian exporter-manufacturers were at a huge disadvantage due to overlapping taxes. But with GST, hope is, matters will change for the better. (Image Source: The Dollar Business) MORE GOOD THAN BAD? The successful implementation of GST will depend on its smooth passage in the states, and the formation of a GST council that drives consensus on rates, exclusion lists, applicability limits, principles of supply, special provisions to certain states, and a host of other rules and regulations. Even the time chosen for implementation will matter a lot when it comes to confusion and litigations. “Full-fledged IT system should be in place so that there is no dispute in arriving at the losses incurred by states in the first five years. An April 1, 2017 rollout may affect the last quarter business of FY2017. Hence, implementation during mid 2017-18 would be ideal and preferable,” says Ashok P. Hinduja, Chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies. Whatever be the implementation hassles and timeframe, the fact remains GST is a big step towards making India a unified market. The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) will not only reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services, but will also increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. That by our count is more good than bad. Note: This article was Originally Published in The Dollar Business by TDB INTELLIGENCE UNIT September, 2016 ?

Exports play a vital role in Indian economy. Exports bring in the precious foreign currency in India which helps it sustain the balance of Trade. The balance of trade is a difference between in value between a country’s imports and exports. The balance of trade is the largest factor contributing towards the Current Account Deficit (CAD). Current Account Deficit (CAD) Current Account Deficit is a situation when nation’s value of imports is greater than the value of exports. It is calculated regarding percentage to GDP. Any percentage of more than 5 % of GDP will have a negative impact on the economy as the difference will have to finance either by borrowing or by inviting capital investment. Here are some of the outlined points on Current Account Deficit; The developing nation like India often witness the current account Deficit, this is mainly due to lack of technology and proper infrastructure. If the deficit is financed by borrowing, then the country will have more chances to fall under debt trap. As in the long term, the country will be burdened with high-Interest payments, and if it does not generate enough cash flow to repay the debt, then it tends to take more debt to repay the existing one, and the cycle continues. If the deficit is financed by Foreign Direct Investment (as in the case of India), then also, it is considered as harmful in the longer run. In this case, countries growth somehow depends upon the investor confidence. If any time, the country fails to attract the investment, it could lead to severe consequences. Also, the lot of money will then be taken by the foreign company in the form of outbound investment or dividends in the longer run. India’s position India is growing at a robust pace. Currently, India is the fastest growing economy in the world surpassing China. Hence, it is expected that India will run a Current Account Deficit which is adjusted with the capital account receipts like FDI. The biggest contributor to the CAD turmoil is the import of crude oil and gold. India’s CAD has been narrowed to the eight years low since 2008 to 1.2% of the GDP. This is mainly due to fall in the process of crude oil. Once, the crude oil will start bouncing back; the import bill will again take up his shape and so the current account deficit. India has already placed many barriers to discourage the imports; however , India has to import the goods, oil, gold, etc. to meet its domestic demand. Hence, it is better to increase the export to curtail the effect of rising crude oil on the current account deficit. GST a boon for Exports The government of India is very keen on improving the export infrastructure and export incentives to lavish the Indian and foreign players to invest in India, manufacture in India and sell anywhere. This was the idea to improve the exports from India. India aims to raise the manufacturing sector contribution to GDP to 25% from existing 16%. As said, to achieve the ambitious target, GST will play a vital role. GST will be proposed to remove the web of tax laws, unnecessary litigations, cascading effect, no proper refund mechanism of input tax on all types of export and further. Hence, it would be easier for the government to manage a single tax rather than the multiplicity of taxes. Some of the points are mentioned below; Cost advantage via GST: Once GST is implemented the refund of input taxes would be granted, further the cascading effect will also be removed. This would reduce the most of the production and will offer the cost advantage on the global level which would ultimately boost the exports. Single Tax to Manage: It would be better for government and the industry to manage the single tax rather than multiple tax laws. This will increase compliance with the law and invite lesser interest and penalties. Further, it will also create an environment of trust where things will be clearer and settled which will bring in more investment to boost industrial output and hence ultimately increases export. Lesser Litigation: A business man never wants to indulge in the dispute or legal cases, especially with the government over the tax laws. Further, it has been observed that most of the legal cases happen due to lack of awareness about the laws. Since, GST will be a single indirect tax law, then it would surely enhance the legal friendly environment. More Strong Domestic Market: GST would directly bring in the ease of doing business with the entrepreneur. Hence, once more new business will come into the market and ultimately strengthen the domestic supply helping India reducing the imports or even increasing the exports. Support to Make in India: There is no doubt that GST will support the make in India campaign. Prime Minister Modi said sell anywhere but make in India. GST with its many advantages will bring in more foreign investment and will help India to become an export hub as desired. At last , we can say that GST will have a far-reaching positive impact on exports. Conclusion To know more about the goods and services tax (GST), please subscribe to our monthly magazine .

27," GST rates: Concern over impact on exports of textiles, jewellery Menu NEWS POLICY STATISTICS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SUSTAINABILITY COMPLIANCE HUMAN RESOURCES TEXTILES APPAREL DENIMS Fibres & Yarns KNITS EVENTS FEATURED EVENTS EVENT NEWS SERVICES CONTACT ABOUT US CONTACT US Search NewsLetter Free Subscription Archive Read Archived News Here SPUPOPUPNO1 SPUPOPUPNO1 SUBSCRIBE FOR FREE NEWSLETTER * Your Email Address: HELP US TO SERVE YOU BETTER You Sell (Product): You Buy (Product): Name: Country: * Name of the Company: * Designation: * Phone/Mobile No.: Web Site: Tuesday, 23 May 2017 16:27 GST rates: Concern over impact on exports of textiles, jewellery The commerce ministry fears that a higher than expected goods and services tax (GST) rate on gems and jewellery and textiles products may make such exports uncompetitive and exporters may have to be compensated. These two items are among six on which GST rates could not be finalized in the 14th GST council meeting in Srinagar that was last week and a decision was delayed until the next meeting on 3 June. A commerce ministry official stated that after GST rates are imposed, if the tax rates increases on textiles and gems and jewellery sectors, then there will be need to evaluate how much more support they may require, because the margins in the international market are fixed and higher taxes may make them uncompetitive. Also, there won’t be uniform rates for textiles and gems and jewellery items as the products vary widely. At present, taxes on textile products vary from 4 per cent to as high as 60 per cent. Rahul Mehta, president of the Clothing Manufacturers Association of India in a note posted on its website wrote that from all the informal feedback the association has received, government is likely to impose 12 per cent GST rate on the sector and the government has not considered the industry fit to be taxed at the lowest slab of 5 per cent, which would have given a tremendous boost to the industry. The Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council has demanded to fix GST rate at 1.25 per cent for the sector with continuing exemptions for diamonds. Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia in an interaction with a news channel pointed out that the GST rate for all branded products including textiles will be decided on 3 June. He further stated that a final decision is yet to be taken on whether branded products should be treated differently from non-branded products, he also suggested that manufacturers of branded products will benefit if a GST rate is imposed since they will be able to claim input credit.

Home > Newsroom > News releases > GST does not give confidence to exporting community Published Editorial GST does not give confidence to exporting community September 2016 Inside News releases PR contacts PR activities Analyst relations Fact and figures Published Editorials Share The Financial Express By Vivek Pachisia Tax Partner, Technology, EY India GST will be a game-changing reform for the Indian economy which promises a common Indian market and reduction of cascading effect of tax on the cost of goods and services. GST will have a far-reaching impact on almost all aspects of business operations in the country; for instance, impact on pricing of products and services, supply-chain optimisation, IT systems, policies and processes, accounting and tax compliance systems, etc. More specifically, in the context of indirect taxes, GST will impact tax structure, incidence, computation, payment, compliance, credit utilisation and reporting leading to a complete overhaul of the current indirect tax system of any organisation operating in India. The Model GST Law released on June 14 has attempted to address indirect tax disputes currently prevailing in the technology sector. Foremost, it has attempted to address the historical dispute of levy of dual indirect taxes (VAT vis-a-vis service tax) on right to use intangibles such as IT software, trademarks, etc. ‘Service’ has been defined to include intangible property and the definition of ‘goods’ excludes intangibles. Additionally, the transfer of right to use any goods has been defined as a deemed service. This clear articulation should put to rest the historic dual treatment of software and other intangibles as both ‘goods’ and ‘services’. While doing so, ambiguity still persists where intangibles are supplied on a tangible medium which could be a point of representation by the industry. Further, the place of supply for B2B transactions being linked to the location of service recipient with no exceptions being carved for IT/ITeS services, online information and database access services, intermediary services and performance-based services (like IT maintenance and testing services) is another welcome move from service exporters’ perspective. ‘Zero-rating’ has been rightly preserved for export of goods and services. However, it appears that no scheme for upfront GST exemption/zero-rating is in the offing for supply of goods and services to exporters of services (i.e. STP, SEZ, EHTP and EOU units engaged in exports), leading to additional working capital requirement for such units. As things stand, it seems that these units would be given the same treatment as a DTA exporter and will be required to claim refund of the unutilised input GST credits. Hence, it is worthwhile for the industry to represent on such discontinuance of benefits. As regards the IT hardware sector, discontinuation of concessional duty benefits currently available to manufacturers of mobile phones, tablets, etc, could have a tax-cost impact. The good news is that, with various taxes which were currently not available as credit (like CST) being subsumed into GST, this would help unlock the cascading impact in the value-chain and, thereby, reduce the impact of incremental tax rates on such final product, if any. Moreover, the apprehension of a decentralised registration and compliances in each state of operation appears to be confirmed by the Model GST Law. Consequently, service providers may need to value and discharge GST in each state of operation in respect of services delivered under a single contract (like multi-state contracts) from multiple offices across the country. Also, splitting the contract or contract value state-wise can entail practical challenges in monetising the value of services delivered from each location. GST could also entail for careful planning of the supply chain to ensure that GST credits are not accumulated or lost. The Model GST law has attempted to address various issues plaguing the technology sector. However, it does not seem to inspire required level of confidence to the exporting community, particularly export-oriented units set up basis a promise of tax and duty exemptions. Given that the ‘Revenue-Neutral Rate’ report suggests a lower rate for merit/essential goods, it remains to be seen whether the expectations of the IT industry for a merit rate are met. Since the rolling out of GST seems to be closer to reality with a target date of April 1, 2017, companies have already commenced working towards the transition to GST, and for the ones that have not yet started, would need to have a plan to address the challenges of crash-landing into the GST regime. Given the far-reaching impact of GST across the business organisation and its value-chain across businesses, as part of the process towards effective GST transition, companies may need to adopt a comprehensive business transformation approach. This would involve a business impact analysis, reviewing business delivery and supply-chain models, engaging with the government on issues of representation, preparing IT systems to be GST-compliant, reviewing and aligning the policies, processes and controls across the business organisation to GST requirements, and plan an effective change management programme. This would ensure zero business disruption and 100% GST compliance. Connect with us Stay connected with us through social media, email alerts or webcasts.

29," GST will bring foreign investors flocking to India, boost exports | Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis Photos Videos Topics Live Cricket Score Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GST will bring foreign investors flocking to India, boost exports (Getty Images) Shares 11 Rajrishi Singhal | Fri, 5 Aug 2016-11:23am GST will remove the multiplicity of taxes currently in place in India and simplify the indirect tax regime in the country. The passage of the Constitution (122nd amendment) Bill, 2014, on Wednesday allows for the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a unified and pan-national tax structure. GST will create a common domestic market, remove distortions arising out of a multiplicity of levies and rates, and foster efficiency by minimising the cascading effect of taxes in the manufacturing chain. GST will also have a beneficial impact on India’s economic diplomacy, including foreign trade. The GST fits nicely into the Modi government’s drive to improve ease-of-doing business in the ‘Make In India’ campaign. Manifold taxes, with differential rates in different states, created hurdles for the smooth conduct of business and added costs at every stage, frustrating foreign investors. Foreign investment decisions and the expected rate of return from projects often suffered due to these distortions, occasionally even deterring fresh investment plans. Most global value chains, with the exception of Foxconn, have avoided investing in India because of regulatory and bureaucratic tangles, especially those related to the multi-layered tax regime. The successful implementation of GST will reverse this, helping to attract new investments especially from global value chains which often aggregate inputs from different constituencies. ALSO READ GST Bill to be bittersweet for e-commerce firms; here's why The other immediate beneficiary will be Indian exports which have long suffered from lack of international competitiveness due to differential taxes and the energies expended on complying with the complex tax labyrinth. A 2010 report from National Council of Applied Economic Research had found that eliminating cascading taxes on exports could increase GDP growth by 0.9-1.7%. For instance, a garments manufacturer and exporter has to depend on multiple suppliers of inputs – finished cloth (processed and dyed), threads, buttons, zips, sewing machines, ironing products, packaging, labels – for producing his finished good. These suppliers in turn, source raw materials from multiple sources, located in multiple locations, each party paying multiple taxes in different tax jurisdictions. At each stage, goods get delayed in transit for assessment and payment of varied levies – sales tax, octroi, excise, service tax. This fosters inefficiency and adds costs to each additional layer for the exporter. In addition, with each state legislating separate laws, meant that exporters couldn’t claim full set-off on the free-on-board price, rendering exports uncompetitive. ALSO READ GST to be for 'Make in India' across sectors GST will alleviate this. The Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) for 2015-20 says: “The simplification and harmonisation of the indirect tax regime of the country will reduce the cost of production and lead to a seamless, integrated Indian market, thereby making Indian trade and industry more competitive.” The benefit to services exports will become clearer in the next few weeks, but right away, the travel, tourism and hospitality sector is a clear winner because of its dependence on a wide spectrum of vendors and suppliers. ALSO READ After Yes vote, government stares at GST rate challenge As the implications and impact of this simplifying legislation starts to make itself apparent and the GST’s advantages for incoming foreign investment and out-going exports gain momentum, it will add veracity to Prime Minister Modi’s on-going economic diplomacy efforts.

Export and import of service has been defined under Section 2 of the GST Law which has been reproduced as under : The supply of any service shall be treated as an “import of service” if, The supplier of service is located outside India, The recipient of service is located in India, The place of supply of service is in India, and The supplier of service and the recipient of service are not merely establishments of a distinct person; Explanation 1:- An establishment of a person in India and any of his other establishment outside India shall be treated as establishments of distinct persons. Explanation 2:- A person carrying on a business through a branch or agency or representational office in any territory shall be treated as having an establishment in that territory. Section 2(52) o f the Central GST Act The supply of any service shall be treated as “export of service” B when The supplier of service is located in India, The recipient of service is located outside India, The place of supply of service is outside India, The payment for such service has been received by the supplier of service in convertible foreign exchange, and The supplier of service and recipient Explanation: – For the purposes of clause (e) an establishment of a person in India and any of his other establishment outside India shall be treated as establishments of distinct persons. Section 2(44) of the Central GST Act, 2016 Note: place of supply of services shall be determined vide Section 6 of the IGST Act 2016. Supply of goods/services in the course of import and export has been considered as Inter-State trade or commerce and provision of IGST shall be applicable . In this respect once again kind attention is drawn towards the following definition of IGST: Section 2(c) of IGST Act, 2016 “Integrated Goods and Services Tax” (IGST) means tax levied under this Act on the supply of any goods and /or services in the course of inter State trade or commerce. Explanation 1 – A supply of goods and/or services in the course of Import into the territory of India shall be deemed to be a supply of goods and/ or services in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. Explanation 2 – An export of goods and/ or services shall be deemed to be a supply of goods and/ or services in the course of inter-state trade or commerce. Tax Structure and Input Credit Since the import of goods/services would be deemed as inter-state supply of goods and thus shall be subjected to the levy of IGST. However the import of goods shall continue to attract Basic Customs Duty (BCD) in addition to IGST. The manufacturer, service provider and trader of goods who imports goods/services shall be eligible to offset IGST paid on import of goods/services against his output liability. However, credit of BCD will not be available under proposed GST law as well. Note:- In the opinion of speaker, same rate of IGST shall be applicable in both cases i.e. import of goods/ services from non-taxable territory and inter-state supply of goods/services form non-taxable territory and interstate supply of goods/services within India as no separate rates are prescribed in the proposed GST law. Section 2(109) of the proposed Central Act, 2016 “Zero rated supply” means a supply of any goods and/ or services on which no tax is payable but credit of the input tax related to that supply is admissible; GST shall not be charged on goods/services exported from India. In Case, the supply of goods qualifies as export out of India as per the Place of Supply Rules the transaction shall be treated as “zero rated supply”. The supplier shall be allowed to export the goods/services without charging any tax, and can avail the CGST/SGST and IGST credits paid on inputs and input services. If he is unable to utilize the credit then he can go for refund of credits as per section 38 of proposed Central GST Act, 2016 Section 38:- Refund of Tax Any person claiming refund of any tax and interest, if any, paid on such tax or any other amount paid by him, may make an application in that regard to the proper officer of IGST/CGST/SGST before the expiry of two years from the relevant date in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed: Provided that the limitation of two years shall not apply where such tax or interest or the amount referred to above has been paid under protest. Subject to the provisions of sub-section (8), a taxable person may claim refund of any unutilized input tax credit at the end of any tax period: Provided that no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be allowed in cases other than exports or in cases where the credit has accumulated on account of rate of tax on inputs being higher than the rate of tax on outputs: Provided further that no refund of unutilized input tax credit shall be allowed in cases where the goods exported out of India are subjected to export duty. Impact on GST on Import and Export Even after introduction of GST following duties may not be subsumed under GST regime and they may continue to be levied as at present: Basic Customs Duty Anti Dumping Duty Safeguard Duties The GST will streamline the import framework in India as various custom duties will be subsumed into IGST and will make cross border trade easier. GST will ensure proper compliance at different levels. Trader who sells imported goods in India will also be able to claim input tax credit on IGST, reducing costs even further.

We are small merchant exporters and do not pay excise duty to the manufacturer by submitting CT1 and ARE1. Along with other documents, we submit custom officer signed 1st and 2nd copy of ARE 1 to excise department and get the amount credited to our running bond account and obtain proof of export. We do not pay VAT on export and get form H from the department and give it to the factory. From your article, we get a feel that we shall be paying 18 % GST to the manufacturer at the time of taking out goods from the factory and claim refund afterwards. As a merchant exporter, we may have small credits on account of service provider. Our Question: What documents will need to be submitted to prove that consignment has been exported? How to claim refund against export and how much time this is going to take? Reply Leave a comment Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

This means that: You may need to charge, collect, and remit the GST/HST on your taxable supplies of property and services you make in Canada You may need to file GST/HST returns on a regular basis You may be able to claim ITCs to recover the GST/HST paid or payable on your purchases and operating expenses For more information, see Registering for a GST/HST account . Find out how the GST/HST applies to imports and exports Different GST/HST rules apply for businesses that import or export goods or services. Select the situation that applies to you to get more details. Imports Imports Most goods imported into Canada are subject to the federal GST, which is calculated at the rate of 5% of the duty-paid value of the shipment. This tax must be paid at time of entry and is collected at the border, unless the goods are going directly to a bonded warehouse. In this case, the GST is collected when the goods leave the warehouse and become eligible for sale in Canada. Several provinces have combined the GST with their provincial sales taxes on various categories of goods, thus creating a Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). On most commercial imports, however, only the federal (GST) portion of the HST is applied to the sale. To know which supplies are GST/HST taxable and at which rate , see Which GST/HST rate to charge . Select the situation that applies to you to get more details. Find out how the GST/HST applies to imported goods Find out how the GST/HST applies to imported goods Goods you import into Canada are subject to the GST or the federal part of the HST, except for items specified as non-taxable importations. The GST/HST is calculated on the Canadian dollar value of the goods, including duty and excise tax, and is collected at the border at the same time as these duties and taxes. The owner or importer of record is responsible for paying the GST/HST on imported goods. If you are registered for the GST/HST and you are the importer (the person who caused the goods to be imported into Canada), you may claim an input tax credit (ITC) for the tax you paid on the imported goods, as long as you meet the requirement for claiming ITCs. In this section: Non-taxable importations Imported goods into a participating province Self-assessment of the provincial part of the HST Recovery of the provincial part of the HST Non-taxable importations No tax applies to items specified as non-taxable importations. See example - Non-taxable importations Examples of non-taxable importations certain zero-rated goods (goods that are specifically taxed at 0% in Canada, such as prescription drugs) medals, trophies, and other prizes won outside Canada in competition (but not saleable goods, such as an automobile) tourist literature imported by governments or specified organizations for public distribution free of charge goods imported by a charity or public institution that have been donated to the charity or institution goods imported for the sole purpose of maintenance, overhaul, or repairs, if the title or use to those goods does not pass while they are in Canada, and the goods are exported as soon as the services are completed goods imported by manufacturing service companies where the goods are processed for non-residents and later exported without being used in Canada. Any parts to be used in or attached to, and materials directly consumed or expended in the processing of those goods, are also non-taxable. The manufacturing service companies must apply in writing for an import certificate to be able to import goods on a non-taxable basis warranty replacement property and replacement parts supplied by a non-resident at no charge other than for shipping and handling goods valued at $20 or less sent to a person by mail or courier at an address in Canada, except for the following prescribed goods: excisable goods (such as beer, tobacco, and wine) books, newspapers, magazines, periodicals, or other similar publications, where the vendor was required to register for the GST/HST, but did not do so goods bought from a retailer in Canada and mailed or transported from outside Canada directly to the purchaser Imported goods into a participating province In most cases, the HST applies at the border to taxable importations of non-commercial goods imported by a resident of a participating province , regardless of the point of entry into Canada or customs clearance. Taxable non-commercial goods imported into a participating province by a resident of such a province are subject to the HST on importation, except for motor vehicles required to be registered in a participating province, or a mobile home or floating home that has been used or occupied in Canada by an individual. Although the provincial part of the HST is not payable when you import commercial goods that are destined for the participating provinces, the goods may be subject to the self-assessment. Generally, the value on which tax is required to be self-assessed is the lesser of the amount paid for the good and the fair-market value of the property. The self-assessment rule for goods will also apply when goods are brought into a particular participating province from another participating province for which the provincial part of the HST is lower . If a person is required to self-assess under this rule, the amount of tax will be determined by multiplying the difference between the provincial part of the HST for the destination participating province and the provincial part of the HST for the origin province by either the amount paid for the property or the fair-market value of the good at the time of bringing it in. See example Example During a business trip, a Prince Edward Island resident purchases a watch in Ontario for $10,000 plus $1,300 HST (5% is the federal part of the HST ($500) and 8% is the provincial part of the HST ($800)). When returning to Prince Edward Island, the Prince Edward Island resident would be required to self-assess tax on the $10,000 at the rate of 2% (the 10% Prince Edward Island provincial part of the HST less the 8% Ontario provincial part of the HST). Self-assessment of the provincial part of the HST If you are registered, the provincial part of the HST is payable when the goods are brought into a participating province. Enter this amount on line 405 of your GST/HST return. You may be entitled to claim an ITC for the tax you self-assess on the goods depending on the percentage of use in your commercial activities. For more details on ITCs, see Input tax credits . If you are not registered for the GST/HST and have to self-assess the provincial part of the HST, use Form GST489, Return for Self-assessment of the Provincial Part of Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) . Recovery of the provincial part of the HST You may be eligible to recover the provincial part of the HST on goods imported in a non-participating province, or imported in a participating province with a lower HST rate. For more information, see Reason code 12 - Goods imported at a place in a non-participating province, or imported at a place in a participating province with a lower HST rate . Find out how the GST/HST applies to imported services and intangible personal property Find out how the GST/HST apply to imported services and intangible personal property If you buy services (such as architectural services for a building in Canada) or intangible personal property (IPP) (such as the right to use a patent in Canada) from an unregistered non-resident person outside Canada, you do not pay the GST or the federal part of the HST if you acquire them to use at least 90% in your commercial activities (100% in the case of a financial institution ). If you do not use the imported services or IPP at least 90% in your commercial activities, you have to report the GST or the federal part of the HST on line 405 of your GST/HST return and remit the tax directly to us. The tax is calculated on the amount you were charged for the service or IPP in Canadian dollars, and the tax is payable in the reporting period in which the amount for the service or the IPP was paid or became payable. If you are not registered for the GST/HST, you still have to pay tax on imported services or IPP. Use Form GST59, GST/HST Return for Imported Taxable Supplies, Qualifying Consideration, and Internal and External Changes , to remit the tax. The tax is due by the end of the month following the calendar month in which the amount for the services or IPP was paid or became payable. In this section: Imported services and IPP into a participating province Self-assessment of the provincial part of the HST Imported services and IPP into a participating province If you are a resident in a participating province , you may have to pay the provincial part of the HST if you buy services or IPP in a non-participating province and the following conditions apply: the imported services or IPP are not used at least 90% in your commercial activities; and the services or IPP are for consumption, use, or supply more than 10% in the participating provinces. You may also have to self-assess the provincial part of the HST if you use, consume, or supply goods, services or IPP in a participating province with a higher HST rate than the participating province where you acquired them. You do not have to self-assess the provincial part of the HST if the tax payable from all amounts to be self-assessed in a calendar month is less than $25 . You do not have to self-assess the provincial part of the HST if you are a registrant and the service or IPP is consumed, used, or supplied at least 90% in your commercial activities. For more information on the rules, and the formula for self-assessment for services and IPP, see Guide RC4022, General Information for GST/HST Registrants . Self-assessment of the provincial part of the HST If you are registered, the provincial part of the HST is payable when the services or IPP are brought into a participating province. Enter this amount on line 405 of your GST/HST return. If you are not registered for GST/HST and have to self-assess the provincial part of the HST, use Form GST489, Return for Self-assessment of the Provincial Part of Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) . Exports Exports Goods and services that are normally subject to the GST/HST may be untaxed when exported from Canada. In this case, they are referred to as “zero-rated” goods or services.

Find out how the GST/HST applies to exported goods Find out how the GST/HST applies to exported goods Generally, there are two ways for exported goods supplied in Canada to be zero-rated (taxed at 0%). The first is if the following conditions are met when the purchaser takes delivery of the goods in Canada: the goods are not excisable goods, such as beer and tobacco the purchaser is not a consumer (a consumer is usually an individual who is buying the goods for his or her personal use) the purchaser exports the goods as soon as is reasonable in the circumstance after you deliver them the purchaser does not buy the goods to consume, use, or supply in Canada before exporting them after buying the goods and before exporting them, the purchaser does not further process, transform, or alter the goods in Canada, unless it is reasonably necessary or incidental to transport them you keep satisfactory evidence, for audit purposes, that the purchaser has exported the goods if the property being exported is electricity, crude oil, natural gas, or any good that can be transported by means of a wire, pipeline, or other conduit, the purchaser is not registered for GST/HST purposes The second is if the goods are not a continuous transmission commodity that is being transported by means of a wire, pipeline, or other conduit, and the supplier: ships the goods to a destination outside Canada that is specified in the contract for carriage of the goods transfers possession of the goods to a common carrier or consignee that: is retained to ship the property to a destination outside Canada is retained either by the supplier on the recipient’s behalf or by the recipient’s employer sends the goods by mail or courier to an address outside Canada If the conditions for zero-rating are not met , you have to charge and the purchaser has to pay the GST/HST on taxable supplies. Note A non-resident purchaser (other than a consumer) can apply for a rebate to recover the tax paid on qualifying goods (other than excisable goods, wine, and gasoline) exported from Canada. To qualify for the GST/HST rebate, the non-resident purchaser has to export the goods from Canada within 60 days of delivery, as well as meet other conditions. For more information, see Guide RC4033, General Application for GST/HST Rebates , and Form GST189, General Application for Rebate of GST/HST . A purchaser who is registered for GST/HST purposes can apply for authorization to issue an export certificate, which, when provided to the supplier, will cause the goods to be zero-rated. For more information, see GST/HST Memoranda Series Chapter 4-5-2, Exports - Tangible Personal Property . Find out how the GST/HST applies to exported services Notice to reader Under proposed changes, the supply of a service of rendering technical or customer support to individuals by means of telecommunications (for example, by telephone, email, or web chat) will generally be zero-rated for GST/HST purposes under certain conditions. This measure will apply to supplies made after Budget Day. For more information, see Exported Call Centre Services in the 2016 Federal Budget - Tax Measures: Supplementary Information . Find out how the GST/HST applies to exported services You do not charge the GST/HST on services you perform totally outside Canada, or on services that relate to real property situated outside Canada. Services, other than transportation services, that you perform on temporarily imported goods are zero-rated . The goods must be brought into Canada for the sole purpose of having the service performed on them and must be exported as soon as possible. Any parts supplied along with these services are also zero-rated. Certain services provided to a non-resident person , but not to an individual while the individual is in Canada, that are performed all or partly in Canada may be zero-rated, such as: certain advisory, professional, or consulting services; advertising services to an unregistered non-resident person; advisory, consulting, or research services to help a non-resident person establish a residence or business in Canada; services and parts for goods or real property acquired to fulfill an obligation under warranty for an unregistered non-resident person; custodial or nominee services for the non-resident person's securities or precious metals; training services to an unregistered non-resident person (other than an individual) to teach non-resident individuals or to give examinations for courses leading to certificates, diplomas, licences, or similar documents, or classes or licence ratings that attest to the individuals' competence or to give an exam to practise or perform a trade or vocation; services to an unregistered non-resident person of destroying or discarding goods, or the services of dismantling goods for the purpose of exporting them; services to an unregistered non-resident person of testing or inspecting goods acquired or brought into Canada for this service and the goods are to be destroyed or discarded in the course of providing the service or on its completion; services of acting as an agent for a non-resident person or services of arranging for, procuring, or soliciting orders for supplies by or to the person when the service relates to a zero-rated property or service, or if the supply to or by the non-resident person is made outside Canada; and services made in Canada to a non-resident person by electronic means , may be zero-rated. For more information, see GST/HST Technical Information Bulletin B-090, GST/HST and Electronic commerce . Remember that you can claim input tax credits to recover the GST/HST you paid or owe on purchases and expenses related to your zero-rated goods and services. See Input tax credits for more information. Find out how the GST/HST applies to exports of intangible personal property Find out how the GST/HST applies to exports of intangible personal property Supplies of intangible personal property (IPP) that may not be used in Canada are considered to be made outside Canada, and are therefore not subject to the GST/HST. Also, supplies of intellectual property (such as a patent or trademark) and rights to use such property are zero-rated if they are made to non-registered non-residents . Most supplies of IPP (other than intellectual property) made to persons who are non-registered non-residents are zero-rated except for the following: a supply made to an individual unless the individual is outside Canada when the supply is made; a supply of IPP that relates to real property that is situated in Canada or to tangible personal property that is ordinarily situated in Canada; a supply of IPP that relates to a supply of a service that is made in Canada and is not zero-rated as an export, a transportation service or a financial service; a supply of IPP that may only be used in Canada; or a supply of making a telecommunications facility that is IPP available for use in providing a telecommunication service. For supplies of IPP to qualify for zero-rating, suppliers must verify and maintain satisfactory evidence of the registration status and residency of their customers at the time the supply is made. In addition, for supplies of IPP other than intellectual property, suppliers must verify and maintain satisfactory evidence of the physical location of their customers at the time the supply is made. Note Zero-rating applies to eligible supplies of IPP (other than intellectual property) made after March 19, 2007, and to eligible supplies of IPP made on or before March 19, 2007, if GST/HST was neither charged nor collected. If you are a registrant who has made such supplies on or before March 19, 2007, and the Canada Revenue Agency has taken an amount into account in assessing your net tax for a reporting period as GST/HST that became collectible in respect of such supplies, you may be eligible for a refund of any resulting overpayment in respect of the supplies. See GST/HST Info Sheet GI-034, Exports of Intangible Personal Property , for further information. If you are a GST/HST registrant, you have to charge and the purchaser has to pay GST/HST on taxable supplies of IPP unless they are zero-rated or made outside Canada. Drop shipment rules Drop shipment rules A drop-shipment generally happens when a non-resident who is not registered for GST/HST acquires goods from a registrant in Canada and tells the registrant to deliver the goods to another person in Canada. A drop-shipment also occurs when an unregistered non-resident contracts with a registrant in Canada to have certain commercial services performed on goods, and the registrant causes the goods to be delivered to another person in Canada or to a non-resident person for export. The drop-shipment rules generally relieve the non-resident (the supplier) who is not registered for GST/HST from paying tax. An unregistered non-resident can take advantage of the drop-shipment rules where a GST/HST registrant sells goods to the unregistered non-resident or does commercial services-manufacturing, processing, inspecting, testing, repair, maintenance, or storage, on goods owned by the unregistered non-resident and then delivers them to a third party. The third party may be a customer of the non-resident or another resident who is taking possession of the goods for the purpose of performing additional work on them. In this section: Drop-shipments to registered persons Drop-shipments to unregistered persons Drop-shipments to registered persons When a GST/HST registrant transfers physical possession of your goods to a third party ( consignee ) who is a GST/HST registrant, the consignee must issue a drop-shipment certificate to the registrant in order for tax not to apply to the supply of goods or commercial services from the GST/HST registrant to you. Drop-shipment certificates ensure that consignees are aware of their potential GST/HST liability when another registrant transfers physical possession of your goods to them. By issuing the certificate, the consignees acknowledge that they are responsible for the GST/HST payable if they do not acquire the goods for consumption, use, or supply exclusively in the course of commercial activities, or if an unregistered person ultimately uses the goods in Canada. For more information, see Drop-shipments to unregistered persons . We accept blanket drop-shipment certificates. These certificates cover more than one transfer of physical possession of goods from one registrant to another (the consignee). See example Example You buy radios from a registered supplier. You instruct the supplier to have the radios delivered to a registered inspector. The inspector provides the supplier with a drop-shipment certificate. The supplier invoices you for the radios, but does not charge GST/HST. You instruct the inspector to deliver the radios to a registered customer. The customer provides the inspector with a drop-shipment certificate. The inspector invoices you for the inspection service, but does not charge GST/HST. You invoice the customer, and as an unregistered non-resident, you do not charge GST/HST. A valid drop-shipment certificate must contain the following information: the consignee's name and Business Number (BN); the consignee has taken or will take physical possession of the goods; the goods are acquired for the purpose of performing commercial services on them or that they are for the recipient's consumption, use, or supply; and the consignee assumes liability to pay or remit any GST/HST that may become payable. Note A registrant may become liable to account for tax on an unregistered non-resident 's goods upon taking physical possession of those goods. The liability does not come from issuing a drop-shipment certificate. It can only be avoided by not taking physical possession of the goods. To learn more how drop-shipment rules apply see the following: Transfer of goods to a carrier or warehouse A GST/HST registrant transfers your goods to a carrier or warehouse (bailee) and at the same time tells the bailee to transfer the goods to a third party. The registrant must obtain a drop-shipment certificate from the third party in order for tax not to apply to the supply of goods/commercial services from the GST/HST registrant to you. A GST/HST registrant transfers your goods to a warehouse and the warehouse operator is instructed under the agreement for the storage of the goods to store the goods. The goods are stored until a third party purchaser is found, and the registrant is not required to charge tax on the sale of the goods to you. However, the registrant remains potentially liable for tax on the fair market value of the goods unless, at the time of the transfer of the goods to the third party, the registrant obtains a drop-shipment certificate from the third party. A GST/HST registrant transfers your goods to a warehouse and instructs the warehouse operator to release the goods to you. The registrant is regarded as transferring physical possession to you in Canada and the transaction is subject to GST/HST. If you plan to sell the goods to a registrant, and the goods will not leave Canada, in order not to pay tax to the first registrant, you can instruct the warehouse to issue a drop-shipment certificate to the registrant. When the certificate is issued, the warehouse operator becomes potentially liable for tax on the fair market value of the goods unless, at the time of the transfer of physical possession of the goods to a third party, the warehouse operator obtains a drop-shipment certificate from the third party. If a warehouse operator acts as the importer of record for goods you transfer to the warehouse and claims an input tax credit for the importation of the goods, we consider the warehouse operator to have taken physical possession of the goods. The warehouse operator has to pay GST/HST to us if and when physical possession of the goods is transferred to another person on your behalf, unless the warehouse operator obtains a drop-shipment certificate from the person to whom he or she transfers physical possession of the goods. Goods kept by registered suppliers When a GST/HST registrant sells goods to you and transfers ownership, but not physical possession of the goods to you, the registrant does not charge GST/HST on the sale if the registrant keeps physical possession of the goods in order to do the following: transfer physical possession of the goods to you, a subsequent owner, or another person designated by you or a subsequent owner; or perform a commercial service on the goods for you or a subsequent owner. The registrant assumes potential liability for the goods when physical possession of the goods is transferred to another person. The registrant is relieved of this liability when the registrant receives a drop-shipment certificate from the third party at the time physical possession is transferred. Goods subsequently exported A GST/HST registrant does not charge GST/HST on the sale of goods and the supply of commercial services to an unregistered non-resident , if the registrant does the following: transfers physical possession of the goods at a place in Canada to a person who will export the goods within a reasonable amount of time and the conditions for zero-rated exports are met. transfers physical possession of the goods to a carrier for export and delivery to a person outside Canada; or transfers physical possession of the goods to a person at a place outside Canada. For more information on exportation, see Exported goods . Conditional sales contracts and sale-leaseback arrangements Normally, GST/HST would apply to the sale of goods by a registrant to an unregistered non-resident where the registrant subsequently leases them back and the goods remain in Canada. However, under the drop-shipment rules, no GST/HST is charged. These rules also apply if the unregistered non-resident is purchasing the goods for the purpose of leasing them to another registrant in Canada. In this situation, the second registrant must issue a drop-shipment certificate to the first registrant and will only be required to self-assess tax if the second registrant is acquiring the goods for use in non-commercial activities. When the drop-shipment rules do not apply The drop-shipment rules do not apply to common carriers that take possession of goods for the sole purpose of shipping the goods. In all cases, fees for shipping goods are subject to GST/HST. We consider the transfer of the goods to the carrier for transportation and delivery to another person to be a transfer of physical possession of the goods to the person to whom the goods are to be delivered. That person can choose to follow the drop-shipment rules. Drop-shipments to unregistered persons If you instruct a GST/HST registrant to deliver goods in Canada to an unregistered consignee such as a consumer, GST/HST is payable when the registrant delivers or transfers the goods to the recipient. GST/HST is as follows: based on the fair market value of the goods, if the registrant transfers physical possession of the goods in Canada to you or to a third person; or nil, if you provide the goods to a customer free of charge and the registrant transfers physical possession of the goods to the customer in Canada on your behalf. These rules also apply if a registered consignee does not issue a drop-shipment certificate to the GST/HST registrant. Determine which export programs provide GST/HST relief You may be eligible for relief of the GST/HST on certain imports and domestic purchases. Use the following tabs to find out more about the two programs. Export Distribution Centre Program Export Distribution Centre Program (EDCP) The Export Distribution Centre Program (EDCP) permits eligible export-oriented businesses that do not manufacture or produce goods and that add limited value to goods in the course of their processing or distribution activities to use an EDCP certificate to acquire or import , without having to pay the GST/HST, most inventory, property to be added to other goods in the course of processing, and customers' goods on which processing services are provided. For more information, see GST/HST Technical Information Bulletin B-088, Export Distribution Centre Program . Find out if you are eligible to apply for an authorization You can participate in the EDCP if all of the following apply: You are a GST/HST registrant . You are engaged exclusively (90% or more) in commercial activities It can reasonably be expected that during the fiscal year in which the authorization will be in effect, all of the following criteria are met: Your export revenue percentage will be 90% or more You will not engage in substantial alteration of property The value you add to your customers' goods from the provision of non-basic services will be 10% or less, or the total value you add to your customers' goods will be 20% or less How to apply for authorization If you meet the above eligibility conditions, you can apply for an authorization by using Form GST528, Authorization To Use an Export Distribution Centre Certificate . The EDCP authorization is valid for three years , unless it is revoked earlier, and can be renewed. Exporters of Processing Services Program Exporters of Processing Services Program (EOPS) The Exporters of Processing Services Program (EOPS) enables eligible businesses to import certain goods and/or acquire goods in Canada that will eventually be re-exported without paying the GST/HST. A GST/HST registrant may obtain authorization to import goods on a tax-free basis where the goods are imported solely for the purpose of having services performed that are supplied by the registrant to a non-resident person. This program is intended to alleviate the cash-flow cost that would typically occur for such a registrant where the registrant imports the goods and would otherwise be required to pay tax on their importation and then have to wait for a net tax refund to be paid to recover the tax. The GST/HST registrant must import the goods for the purpose of supplying a ""processing"", storage, or distribution service in respect of the goods in Canada in circumstances in which the goods, or the product of their processing, if any, will subsequently be exported without having been consumed or used in Canada except to the extent reasonably necessary or incidental to the transportation of the goods. For this program, ""processing"" includes adjusting, altering, assembling or disassembling, cleaning, maintaining, repairing or servicing, inspecting or testing, labelling, marking, tagging or ticketing, manufacturing, producing, packing, unpacking or repacking, and packaging or repackaging. This includes imported goods that are to be incorporated or transformed into, attached to, or combined or assembled with, other goods that are processed in Canada. EOPS also applies to imported materials that are consumed or expended directly in the processing of other goods that will be exported without having been consumed or used in Canada. Find out if you are eligible to apply for the GST/HST relief You can participate in the EOPS program if all of the following apply: The processor must be a GST/HST registrant that has been authorized to use the program (the application to use the program must be made prior to the importation of the goods). The GST/HST registrant cannot be closely related to the non-resident owner of the imported goods or to the non-resident recipient of the importer's services if that is another person. The GST/HST registrant does not obtain ownership or co-ownership of the imported goods or of the exported processed products while they are in Canada. However, the importer may supply property, such as components or parts, taken from the importer's own inventory, which is added to the imported goods in the course of their processing. Neither the imported goods or the processed products are the property of a resident while they are in Canada. The GST/HST registrant must not transfer physical possession of the imported goods or the processed products to another person in Canada. For example, the goods cannot be drop-shipped to another service provider in Canada. An exception to this is where the importer transfers possession of the imported goods or the processed products for the purpose of their storage, their transportation to or from a place of storage, or their transportation in the course of being exported. The exportation of the imported goods or processed products must occur within four years from the day on which the goods are accounted for under section 32 of the Customs Act . The GST/HST registrant has provided any security that may be required as a condition of obtaining an import certificate. How to apply the GST/HST relief GST/HST registrants who import duty free goods and have no need to seek duty relief must apply to use the EOPS program by sending a letter making this request to their nearest tax services office . The letter should contain evidence showing that the person will import goods or materials to provide processing services and/or has done so in the past where the resultant products are exported. To apply for duties relief in addition to EOPS relief, see Form K90, Duties Relief Application . Form K90 would be sent to your local CBSA office A review of your operations will be conducted and the CRA tax services will be consulted to determine whether an import certificate for the GST/HST would be allowable. When both offices are in agreement, you will be given a duties relief certificate allowing the GST/HST relief. The authorizations for relief from the payment of the GST/HST under the EOPS program are valid for three years .

GST Pulse: FTP schemes- many questions, very few answers! FTP schemes- many questions, very few answers! GST would aim at reducing the existing duty exemptions. One view is that even the existing exemptions for FTP schemes will be removed. Share 1000 Save Also on KPMG.com In the previous article, we discussed how GST could have an impact on State incentives. In continuation to this thought, in this article let us discuss the impact of GST on Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) benefits. FTP benefits generally include export promotion schemes such as Advance Authorisation, EPCG, etc. and entity-wide exemption schemes such as 100 per cent Export Oriented Units (EOU/ STPI/ EHTP) and Special Economic Zone units (SEZ). FTP is announced by the Commerce Ministry of the Central Government and these benefits are then translated into duty exemptions through notifications issued by the Finance Ministry of the Central Government. Since State Governments are not involved, the benefits are restricted to Central taxes such as Customs duty, Excise duty, Service tax and in some cases Central Sales tax (CST), etc. In the scrip-based schemes such as MEIS or SEIS, the Commerce Ministry issues a scrip to the exporter which can be used for payment of central taxes such as Customs duty or even Excise duty and Service tax on the future procurement of goods/ services . GST would aim at reducing the existing duty exemptions. One view is that even the existing exemptions for FTP schemes will be removed. The proponents of this view say that since exports are any way zero rated (i.e. output is not taxed and input credits are allowed) the refund of input taxes would always be available. However this view does not consider the huge working capital issue that would be faced by exporting units under FTP schemes. Instead of the upfront exemption that is available to them today, they will have to pay the taxes and then claim a refund after the sales cycle is completed and their refund claim is duly scrutinised by the Government – this period could stretch to one year or even more, going by the experience of Service tax or VAT refunds today. During an industry discussion, an EOU player mentioned that an interest cost of 10-12 per cent per annum on the blocked capital can drive some units out of business in a fiercely competitive market with declining exports. Another view is that the central government may agree to provide upfront exemptions whereas State Governments would not. In that scenario, the working capital impact would be slightly reduced. Today, the whole of the customs duty is exempt in case of most of the FTP schemes as it is a central tax. In GST, customs duty is set to have an element of state tax too. When the state tax element is not exempted, it could block the working capital for the exporter. Regarding the payment of duty via duty credit scrips, the business process report on the payment process under GST issued by the Government mentions that such mode of payment would not be allowed in the GST regime. This could have an impact on units relying on such post export scrips. These are only illustrative examples, and the impact would vary under each of the export promotion schemes. Let us see what business can and should do to gauge this impact and then face it. First and foremost, it would be necessary to take stock of all benefits that are being availed by your company currently. Once this inventory is taken, one should work out the working capital impact of GST under each benefit scheme and under the various scenarios and different GST rates. This is necessary as there is no clarity on how FTP schemes will be treated under GST. This could be followed by making a representation to the government citing the industry-specific issues or scheme-specific constraints that the exporters may have. While waiting for GST to be introduced, it would also make sense to take a considered decision on whether the company should apply for newer incentive schemes in the months to come and if yes, which schemes one should apply for. Ideally, if possible, one should complete the export obligation for the current FTP schemes before GST sets in. There would be umpteen questions and very few answers. While we mainly discussed FTP schemes in general, in the next article we plan to focus specifically on EOU, STPI and SEZ units.

BY Rajrishi Singhal Former Senior Fellow, Geoeconomics Studies Subscribe Now The passage of the Constitution (122 nd amendment) Bill, 2014, on Wednesday allows for the launch of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a unified and pan-national tax structure. GST will create a common domestic market, remove distortions arising out of a multiplicity of levies and rates, and foster efficiency by minimizing the cascading effect of taxes in the manufacturing chain. GST will also have a beneficial impact on India’s economic diplomacy, including foreign trade. The GST fits nicely into the Modi government’s drive to improve ease-of-doing business in the ‘Make In India’ campaign. Manifold taxes, with differential rates in different states, created hurdles for the smooth conduct of business and added costs at every stage, frustrating foreign investors. Foreign Investment decisions and the expected rate of return from projects often suffered due to these distortions, occasionally even deterring fresh investment plans. Most global value chains, with the exception of Foxconn, have avoided investing in India because of regulatory and bureaucratic tangles, especially those related to the multi-layered tax regime. The successful implementation of GST will reverse this, helping to attract new investments especially from global value chains which often aggregate inputs from different constituencies. The other immediate beneficiary will be Indian exports which have long suffered from lack of international competitiveness due to differential taxes and the energies expended on complying with the complex tax labyrinth. A 2010 report from National Council of Applied Economic Research had found that eliminating cascading taxes on exports could increase GDP growth by 0.9-1.7 per cent. [1] For instance, a garments manufacturer and exporter has to depend on multiple suppliers of inputs – finished cloth (processed and dyed), threads, buttons, zips, sewing machines, ironing products, packaging, labels – for producing his finished good. These suppliers in turn, source raw materials from multiple sources, located in multiple locations, each party paying multiple taxes in different tax jurisdictions. At each stage, goods get delayed in transit for assessment and payment of varied levies – sales tax, octroi, excise, service tax. This fosters inefficiency and adds costs to each additional layer for the exporter. In addition, with each state legislating separate laws, meant that exporters couldn’t claim full set-off on the free-on-board price, rendering exports uncompetitive. GST will alleviate this. The Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) for 2015-20 says: “The simplification and harmonization of the indirect tax regime of the country will reduce the cost of production and lead to a seamless, integrated Indian market, thereby making Indian trade and industry more competitive.” [2] The benefit to services exports will become clearer in the next few weeks, but right away, the travel, tourism and hospitality sector is a clear winner because of its dependence on a wide spectrum of vendors and suppliers. As the implications and impact of this simplifiying legislation starts to make itself apparent and the GST’s advantages for incoming foreign investment and out-going exports gain momentum, it will add veracity to Prime Minister Modi’s on-going economic diplomacy efforts.

Bharat Sabharwal Corporate Brochure LINK LATEST ISSUE MAR - APR 2017 Download Subscription Form EXIM INDIA PRODUCTS : News Details GST seen benefiting logistics sector Experts and analysts are generally of the opinion that the Goods and Services Tax (GST), passed by the Rajya Sabha last week and which is likely to be implemented from April 1, 2017, has the potential to accelerate growth in the logistics industry, provided the right operational mechanism is established. According to Capt. Vivek Anand, President of Mumbai & Nhava-Sheva Ship-Agents Association (MANSA), ""GST takes a step forward, but establishing operational mechanism now holds key"". Says he: ""The much overdue Goods and Services Tax Bill has moved a step forward towards unifying the Indian market under one tax, though a lot is still left to be done before the entire mechanism is put in place and the tangible benefits could be derived from it. ""While it remains extremely positive for seamless movement of cargo due to the unified tax structure and, in the process, will lead to realignment of warehouses and logistics parks across the country, it will also bring in mild inflation as untaxed goods and services so far will now come under the purview of the tax. ""There may be a short-term pain in the economy as and when it is effectively implemented, in terms of job loss in the unorganised sector, as they will not be able to escape the radar of the tax authorities. ""Companies providing services in inland container depots, container freight stations, multimodal logistics parks and in the container train space will stand to gain from the unified and seamless market and tax structure, thereby enabling efficient logistics at hopefully lower costs. ""What needs to be seen is whether the government can ensure that the GST benefit is passed on to the end-user, especially from the manufacturing sector, as they are going to be the major benefactor of this change in the taxation system. ""However, as mentioned, a lot still needs to be done after the Lok Sabha completes the formal process of ratifying the Bill. At least half of the states need to then ratify the Bill, that will pave the way for the formation of the GST Council, which will have a status like the Election Commission. ""Subsequently, Parliament and state legislatures will need to pass GST Bills that will detail the Central and state GSTs. The GST Council will also have to decide on the GST rates along with deciding on the classification of goods based on the rates. ""If the rollout has to indeed happen from April 1, 2017, these processes, along with the GST IT network, should ideally be complete by the end of CY2016. An early completion of the legislative and administrative processes will help companies to prepare for GST faster."" Capt. Ashok Kumar Bhattacharjee, Secretary-General of Indian Private Ports & Terminals Association (IPPTA), stresses that GST will have significant impact on the logistics sector, indirectly affecting the shipping verticals. ""IPPTA believes, as we are sure the entire shipping industry, that this is a very welcome step and a very important change. Makes India ONE common market with one tax regime. ""It will help in reduction in overall logistics costs for industry as it will facilitate concentrating the distribution hubs, in addition to minimising the leakage in tax revenue. ""Depending on the tax rate proposed in November, the impact on inflation can be established. Should the rate be 16-18 per cent, there will not be a major impact on inflation. In the long run, the new regulation will help in controlling inflation and bring prices down. The extent to which that is possible will depend on the tax efficiencies which can be driven from the new system."" Better operational efficiency in logistics According to CRISIL Research , GST will result in better operational efficiency due to improvement in supply chains. It said in an analysis that since the GST subsumes most of the state-level taxes, it would reduce the need for reconciliation at state borders. This could lead to a dismantling of the web of check posts around the country, thereby speeding up the movement of goods and reducing logistics and inventory management costs, which are very high in India vis-à-vis other countries. CRISIL Research expects the rollout of GST to bring down the logistics costs of companies engaged in the production of non-bulk goods by as much as 20 per cent. Savings will accrue as a result of gradual phasing out of the Central sales tax (CST), consolidation of warehouse space, faster transit of goods since local taxes will be subsumed into the GST and as state level check posts will be dismantled. Indian corporates spend an average of 6-8 per cent of sales towards logistics. GST is expected to facilitate costs savings to the tune of 1-1.5 per cent of sales over a 3-4 year period. Eliminating delays at check posts will yield additional savings of 0.4-0.8 per cent of sales, which will take the overall logistics costs savings to up to 1.5-2 per cent of sales for companies. These cost savings are, however, more likely to be gradual and back-ended as corporates will have to realign their supply chain while ensuring minimum business disruption. According to CRISIL Research, sectors that have set up warehouses due to tax considerations, like consumer durables, pharmaceuticals, FMCG and cement, will be key beneficiaries. However, for sectors like automobiles, which have largely set up warehouses purely for logistical considerations (due to the large stockyard space required), the extent of consolidation will be limited, reducing benefits. Sectors dealing with transportation of bulk commodities like iron ore and coal will have limited impact. Advantage exports Since GST is a tax on consumption (destination-based), exports would be zero-rated, i.e. export prices would not include any taxes. Currently, exports are reimbursed for Central indirect taxes (Excise and Customs duties) but don’t get full offsets for CST and certain state-level taxes such as entry taxes and Octroi. Post-GST, this non-rebated indirect tax-induced distortions would be removed, enhancing competitiveness of Indian exporters, CRISIL Research said.

Blog About Us Contact Us GST and it’s impact on India’s GDP The GST or the Goods and Service Tax Bill, 2014 is Value Added Tax implemented in the country. The comprehensive nature of taxation will help in doing away with all the other indirect taxes which are currently levied by the government at the Centre and State. India being a federal republic, a dual taxation structure will be followed by the central and state governments, known as the Central GST and the State GST respectively. Wider tax base: GST will take into account any taxes paid earlier in the goods/service chain. This will bring in additional revenue as the unorganised sector (currently not a part of the value chain) will be drawn into tax net. This will lead to huge tax collection. Unified and simplified compliance- Large number of taxes imposed by the central government such as Central VAT, excise duty, central sales tax and state government taxes such as VAT on sales, entertainment tax, octroi, etc will be removed by single tax. This will create unified market thereby facilitating seamless movement of goods across states. Reduce classification disputes The GST taxation structure follow destination principle and thus the imports would be subject to GST while exports will be zero-rated. In case of inter-state transportation of goods, the tax would apply in the destination state instead of origin. One of the biggest benefits of implementation of GST will be seen in the logistics sector. Indian trucks which clocks around 280 km per day (on average) much below world average of 400 km per day will get a boost. The dismal performance of trucks is not due to poor roads or less fancy trucks but due to prevailing 11 categories of taxes which are levied on the road transport sector. The ratio of indirect taxes to GDP in India increased from 3.99 per cent in 1950-51 12.7 per cent in 2008-09. However, it has fallen to 4.4 per cent in 2011-12. Export of goods and services as a percentage of gdp for India increased from 22 per cent in 2010 to 25.2 per cent in 2013. Implementation of GST which is zero-rated will result in increase of exports thereby further adding to exports. The revenue neutral GST rate of 10 per cent against the proposed GST rate of 25-27 per cent will further add to the tax receipts. Exports which grew at 13 per cent CAGR during 2010 and 2013 is expected to increase at around 6-8 per cent due to implementation of GST thereby further adding to GDP. Lastly, the GST will result in efficient allocation of factors of production (land and capital) thus resulting in overall price going down. Thus the real return to factors of production will go up. Finally, GST is expected, ceteris paribus, to increase India’s GDP by 1 to 1.8 per cent. The additional gain would be earned during years in future over and above the GDP growth achieved otherwise.

A 2010 report from National Council of Applied Economic Research had found that eliminating cascading taxes on exports could increase GDP growth by 0.9-1.7 per cent.[1] For instance, a garments manufacturer and exporter has to depend on multiple suppliers of inputs – finished cloth (processed and dyed), threads, buttons, zips, sewing machines, ironing products, packaging, labels – for producing his finished good. These suppliers in turn, source raw materials from multiple sources, located in multiple locations, each party paying multiple taxes in different tax jurisdictions. At each stage, goods get delayed in transit for assessment and payment of varied levies – sales tax, octroi, excise, service tax. This fosters inefficiency and adds costs to each additional layer for the exporter. In addition, with each state legislating separate laws, meant that exporters couldn’t claim full set-off on the free-on-board price, rendering exports uncompetitive. GST will alleviate this. The Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) for 2015-20 says: “The simplification and harmonization of the indirect tax regime of the country will reduce the cost of production and lead to a seamless, integrated Indian market, thereby making Indian trade and industry more competitive.”[2] The benefit to services exports will become clearer in the next few weeks, but right away, the travel, tourism and hospitality sector is a clear winner because of its dependence on a wide spectrum of vendors and suppliers. As the implications and impact of this simplifiying legislation starts to make itself apparent and the GST’s advantages for incoming foreign investment and out-going exports gain momentum, it will add veracity to Prime Minister Modi’s on-going economic diplomacy efforts.

40," FIEO Worried on Export Impact of High GST T he Constitution (122nd Amendment) Bill, 2014 has paved the way for introduction of GST in the country. All agencies are gearing up to roll out the GST, the biggest indirect tax reform in the country, from 1st of April, 2017. The GST will be a game changer for Indian economy and expected to increase the GDP growth by about 1-1.5% per annum. It will make India a single market and will facilitate movement of goods across States seamlessly. The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) should reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. GST is also likely to reduce the logistics cost in India which is one of the highest in the world. The multiple-point warehousing by manufacturers to save on CST will be eliminated. With GST on the anvil, manufacturers can set up warehouses for distribution at select strategic for reduced cost of operations . Export sector is worried with the implication of GST on exports. Clarity on Zero Rating of Exports We know that Government is committed to zero rating of exports and the same has been adequately clarified in Section (2) Sub-Section (109) of the Model GST Law. This makes it clear that on exports of goods & services, no tax will be payable but credit of the input tax relating to those exports shall be admissible. However, Section 38 of the Model GST Law refers to refund of taxes on goods & services exported out of India. We require a clarification that the refund facility will be optional for the exporters on the same lines as under the Central Excise Act under which the exporter has the option to clear the exports goods without payment of taxes or takes a refund of the duty paid by him. Those exporters who want exemption from GST on supply of goods /services for exports should be entitled for the same. Section 38 Subsection 4(A) allows provision refund of 80% which may be increased to 90% as allowed presently for VAT in few States. Secondly, this 90% may be refunded within 10 days and the balance 10% within 30 days. Further, Proviso to section 38(3)(b) of the GST Act requires the exporter to file a certificate that the incidence of the tax claimed as refund has not been passed on by him to any person. In case of exports the prices are determined by the competition in the international market and there could be cases where the exporter, in order to stay relevant and continue in business, has to execute orders below the cost which could be construed as passing on the tax refund to the buyer. Hence the said certification should not be made applicable where refund is for input taxes for exports. Exemption from IGST/CGST/SGST on imported/ domestic inputs used in exports For the input used in the goods/services which are exported, the exporters would be eligible for refund of unutilized input tax credit. With a view to ensure quick refund, 80% of the refund on account of exports of goods & services will be given expeditiously, on provisional basis, while balance 20% will be refunded after due verification of documents. For the exporters, the facility of duty free imports/ procurement of inputs for exports should continue else it will lead to increasing requirement of working capital even for payment of IGST /CGST/SGST . This will hit MSME as their cost of capital is quite high, blunting their competitive edge in exports .The exemption will not lead to any loss of revenue as in any case exporters will be entitled to refund which affect their liquidity. Exemption for Merchant Exporters- Form H Merchant exporters were availing exemption from CST against Form-H but since GST would be dispensing with such paper requirement, we have to devise some other mechanism to provide exemption to merchant exporters. GST Council should explore the possibility of providing some separate code in the invoice for such supplies for exports which may be square off when the proof of exports is supplied online to GSTN. Merchant exporters are instrumental in a large chunk of country’s exports and the facility enjoyed by them should continue under the GST. Merchant exporter should not be required to pay tax and claim refund. Exemption for Export Oriented Units EOU Units may be provided exemption from IGST on their imports while supply from DTA to EOU needs to be treated as Zero rated supply. The CST refund facility presently available to EOUs will vanish under GST thereby eroding this advantage. Legislative Changes for SEZ Scheme Suitable legislative changes may be required in the SEZ Act to provide exemption from IGST, CGST, SGST on imports as well as domestic procurement of inputs. Section 26 and Section 30 of the SEZ Act would require appropriate modification to give effect to the same. Since supply from DTA to SEZ is treated as exports, it is to be ensured that zero rebating is available on such supplies. The definition of exports in the Model GST Law is at variance with SEZ Act. We need to synchronize the two to avoid any dispute. Changes in Deemed Exports GST would also require suitable changes in many of the Schemes in the Foreign Trade Policy .The categories of the deemed exports would be notified by the Government on the recommendation of the GST Council. However, deemed exports is vital to provide a level playing field to the domestic manufacturers supplementing “Make in India” and thus zero rating of such supplies would be a preferred option particularly for those supplies which are exempted from Customs Duty and IGST on their imports. Capital goods/ Inputs for export production under instruments Imports of duty free capital goods and inputs under EPCG and Advance Authorization will be subject to IGST under the Model GST Law. However, since such goods are primarily for export purposes with AU condition , GST council should consider to provide exemption from IGST on their imports so that working capital of exporters are not blocked in payment of IGST. The instrument for domestic procurement for exports like ARO/Inland Letter of Credit/Advance Intermediate Authorization also needs to be given similar treatment to provide a level playing field to domestic manufacturers. Drawback Rates Many of the small exporters particularly in handicraft, carpets, handlooms have represented that since they procure the goods from the unorganized sector, the duty paying documents of input tax credit would not be available with them. To address their concern, GST council should recommend to provide duty drawback at two rates, when input tax credit is availed (which will factor only the basic customs duty on imports) and when input tax credit is not availed (which will factor both basic customs duty and input tax credit) on the same lines as available currently in the Drawback Schedule for the CENVAT. Utilization of scrips The utilization of the scrips issued to exporters is also an intricate matter. The MEIS/SEIS scrips will only be eligible for payment of basic customs duty as against their current utilization for payment of basic/additional /excise /service tax, which will hurt the exporters as usability of scrip will be restricted. Government should consider their utilization against CGST and SGST. Supply of Scrips Since sale of scrips are exempted from VAT in few States and subject to 4% VAT in few other States, GST council may keep them under Section 4(v) of Schedule IV of Model GST Law like other financial instrument. Quick Refund through integration The success of GST depends on quick refund of taxes paid by the exporters. We have to work in developing a platform which provides instant refund at the time of exports only by integrating GSTN and ICEGATE so that details of exports are captured on real time basis to ensure such refunds. Definition of India The definition of India for the purpose of IGST is 200 NM and whereas for the purpose of Customs Act is 12 NM plus specified structures up to 200 NM. This can create aberrations. For example High Sea sales between 12 NM and 200 NM may be taxed twice to IGST - once as a supply and later at the time of import. There is also lack of clarity in Model GST law on manner of taxation of supplies terminating/originating in territorial waters and in Continental Shelf (CS) & Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) beyond 12 NM. As per definition of interstate and intra state sales given in IGST Act, these would fall in neither of the two categories. Addition in supplies as Exports Currently, Section 5(1) of CST Act explains the concept of sale in the course of exports of the goods out of the territory of India In terms of amended Article 286, (through 101st Constitutional Amendment) Parliament will need to either amend the said Section 5(1) or frame a new legislation to explain the concept of supply in the course of exports of the goods or services or both out of the territory of India. While doing so, under amended Article 286(2), the following supplies need to be treated as exports: a) Supplies from Indian territory to SEZ and any export oriented unit as prescribed under FTP b) Supplies to Notified Deemed Export Project, including to Authorisation holder c) Supplies by Supporting Supplier(s) TAX on Advance Payment Tax will be required to be paid even on advance payment received for a future sale of goods. Currently, this provision is there only in service tax and there is no provision to pay tax on advance received in respect of an agreement to sell. However, in the proposed GST regime, the same provision will also apply to goods as well which could create lot of problems in cases where the order is cancelled or amended. Reverse Charge Mechanism (RCM) Currently RCM is applicable only for receipt of certain services. Under model GST Provisions (Section 72), RCM shall be applicable both for receiving goods and/ or services. RCM involves complications for assesse and hence alternative simpler mechanism should be developed and RCM should be done away in GST regime In the Model GST Law, the buyer has to check the validity of the registration of the supplier and see whether the supplier has not been blacklisted by the Department. If the buyer has purchased/ availed the services and he is unaware of the fact that Seller is blacklisted, the buyer will come to know only when he will upload the transaction of purchase in the next month while filing the return. To protect interests of the buyer, he should be able to check supplier’s status at the time of payment and should not be held responsible for the default caused between the period of payment and reconciliation. Job Work As per Proviso in Schedule 1 the “supply to job worker is not treated as supply of goods” and hence not subject to levy of GST. However the issues pertaining to return of goods from job worker to Principal’s unit should be simplified in line with the procedure as per Excise notification 214/86. Further, the supply from job worker back to the Principal unit even ‘if not a completed product’ should also not be treated as supply of goods and GST should not be levied. However materials if any that of job worker is used by him in execution of the job work should be subject to GST levy by raising a separate invoice. In case the job worker is not having input services or opting not to claim credit for input service, should be exempt from GST levy where the principal undertakes to pay the tax at the time of his supply of final product. Exemption from GST for Foreign Agency Commission Foreign agents play an important role in getting export orders. Their services are utilised by majority of the exporters and they charge commission which is mentioned in the shipping bills. They are paid as and when the export price realised. They have their offices located abroad and their services are rendered outside India. Under Service Tax Act, Foreign agency commission is exempted from levy of service tax by way of Rule 9( c) of Place of Provision of Service Rules, where in case of intermediary services (including foreign agents) the place of service is location of service provider. Under GST which is consumption based levy it may be subject to tax. Hence specific exemption for commission paid to foreign agents be given. Rebate Since the entire GST is system driven provision be made allowing exporter conversion of CGST credit and SGST credit not utilised/ to be utilised for intra state supply to IGST. The transfer be done by means of a contra document for the transfer tax amount and corresponding value, wherein the exporter will be both the supplier and receiver. The IGST credit ledger be debited to the extent of IGST payable on value of exports. The debit will be only to the extent of credit available and cannot exceed the credit available. This debit amount be refunded in cash to the exporter, for which the exporter has to submit only the proof of exports to the proper officer under IGST or provide the details of exports and the same can be verified online from Customs data. This will obviate the necessary of filing multiple applications, documents and additional man power with the departments and the exporter. The credit transferred from SGST and CGST can be recovered from respective Governments. Any wrong refund of taxes or refund in excess of credit available, be recovered as provided in the GST Act. Insertion of Explanation under Notifications As per Section 10 (3), for the purpose of clarifying the scope or applicability of any notification, an explanation may be inserted within one year of issuance of the notification, which will have effect as if it had always been part of the said notification. The power to insert an Explanation within one year of issuance of a Notification, which would apply ab initio, runs counter to the law declared by the Supreme Court in Union of India vs. Martin Lottery Agencies Ltd. [2009 (14) S.T.R. 593 (S.C.)] and SEDCO Forex International Drill Inc. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax [(2005) 12 SCC 717], which is to the effect that an Explanation does not automatically take effect retrospectively even if it is stated to be “for the removal of doubts”. Hence, Section 10 (3) may kindly be withdrawn. Transition Period (I) In order that the exporters do not loose the Drawback where the goods had been exported under existing law, it is proposed at allow exporters to claim Drawback for shipments made during first 2 or 3 months from the appointed date and the refund made by way of Claim as existing procedures from Customs or CGST/ IGST authorities. The exporter will not be allowed to take input credit of taxes on materials lying in stock, WIP or finished goods on appointed date. However input credit of GST paid on purchases post GST be allowed. (II) Further where pending refund claims to be disposed of under earlier law “Provided that where any claim for refund is fully or partially rejected, the amount so rejected shall lapse.” In the case of exporters, refund claims have been filed after debiting the claim amount in eligible CENVAT credit lying in balance. Refund claim is filed to liquidate the CENVAT credit in to cash under Rule 18 of Central Excise Rules. In existing law if refund is rejected, the exporter is allowed to take back the CENVAT because the nature of CENVAT was eligible and then is at liberty to use this credit for Domestic sales. The same Provision is required in the new GST law as well. There are a number of disputes currently under litigation for denial of such input credits. This is a legitimate Credit available to the exporter and he only debited it to avail of the export duty pass through and rejections on technical grounds are common place. The basic credit itself is not questioned. Not allowing exporters to take credit in case they lose their pleas is amounting to a huge Burden on exporters which is totally unwarranted. "

MS Unnikrishnan MD | Thermax See better Q4; GST may lead to inflationary pressure: Thermax FY17 revenue may be a bit lower than last fiscal year: Thermax GST will help exports for capital goods industry: Thermax In an interview to CNBC-TV18, MS Unnikrishnan, MD of Thermax said that 18 percent goods and services tax (GST) will reduce tax outgo for capital goods industry. He added that capital goods industry pays 24-25 percent for goods sold in same state as manufactured whereas the industry also pays central sales tax (CST) for goods sold in another state. However, GST will help exports for capital goods industry, he said. ""Four or five stages of manufacturing where a different manufacturing set up where it is going to pass-through, it is going to be certainly bringing in a level playing field which is what is available to the competition of Indian companies in the global market,"" he said. Below is the verbatim transcript of MS Unnikrishnan’s interview to Prashant Nair & Ekta Batra. Prashant: How is the capital goods manufacturing industry watching the entire Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates debate which is playing out at this point of time. What is the rate which is going to be acceptable to your industry, to you? A: If you look at manufacturing industries the excise incidence is ranging between 12-13 percent right now and including the cess and everything put together it will come to 12-13 percent. However, if it is a sale within the same state itself, there is a sales tax incidence of almost varying between 10 and 14 percent depending upon the item that you are manufacturing. So, the cumulative impact - the same states sale would be in the region of around 24-25 percent. So, if the government were to fix 18 percent as GST rate then that is going to be reducing the total incidence of tax while a purchase is made, that is point number one. However, when you are going to make an interstate sale, which is also very regular in the manufacturing industry, which means you manufacture in a state and sell it in another state. So, the excise is remaining constant. The central sales tax as of today is only two percent. So, the cumulative tax is maybe around 15-16 percent on the total sale. Now, when it is going to become 18 percent certainly it is going to have a minor increase in the incidence of tax at the time when a consumer purchases it. So, that is the way one has got to understand same state sale versus interstate sale, but if they are going to be limiting at 18 percent for general rate which should encompass, in my opinion, between 65 and 75 percent of the entire sale that has being done in the country. It is going to be benefitting the industry. Second and most important is this should be reducing the way you are going to be managing your tax management system within the company because the country should be treated as one market however complications are going to be increasing because you could have a sales tax registration in every individual state of the country right now as per the new law and you are going to file your returns in each of the state and it is supposed to be online progressively. So, those are the operational impacts which one may have to understand. Now, larger companies who have got a very large balance sheet and virtual presence trans-country, across all the states will find it very easy to transit into this. However, smaller companies which are - I would possibly put at companies which have turnover of maybe Rs 100 crore to Rs 1,000 crore, the medium sale industry, who maybe predominantly operating in a couple of states; their home state plus a couple of peripheral states, they will have to come up with a better tax management system, registrations, a lot needs to be done. So, that is the initial part, but overall I would say for the manufacturing industry it is a step change which all of us should be willing to accept with both hands and it is going to be helping the industry. Ekta: In terms of export-import competitiveness do you think a low rate will discourage import and maybe even encourage exports? A: Certainly because there are unknown taxations in the company which is not cumulated because you may not be buying an equipment for export which would have undergone maybe three or four layers of value additions of three-four different companies. Each one of them wouldn't have been able to offset the Value Added Tax ability (VATability), that is the Central Value Added Tax (CENVAT) or VAT wouldn't have been done. In the current law, once GST is fully amplified and applicable and in vogue then at every stage compounding is reduced. So, the ultimate incidence of taxation on export goods will come down. So, it will be improving the level playing capability, facility that is going to be available for the Indian exporters. A single process may not be having a great benefit but multiple stages of manufacturing where components - say, you make steel, convert that into bar steel, from that you make a component, that component gets into an assembly of a motor or a pump, that pump is utilised in a water treatment plant or a boiler or equivalent to that.

43," ALIGNING TRADE POLICY WITH GST Aligning trade policy with GST Much has been deliberated and written about the changes required under various indirect taxes (service tax, excise duty, VAT) in order to align them with the desired GST (Goods and Services Tax) framework. While the attention accorded to these tax laws is well deserved, one cannot afford to neglect the potential impact of GST on other facets of business and government policies. Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) is once such policy which would need some overhaul in light of the transition to GST. The FTP is primarily focused around export-import guidelines and various incentives available for export of goods and services outside India. In addition, it is also an important source of information for companies effecting deemed exports, i.e., supplies for specified projects/purposes in India (such as power projects, refineries, etc.) that are also eligible for various incentives available for physical exports. Import GST There are at least two proposals under GST that are likely to impact the benefits under the FTP. First, the excise duty is likely to be subsumed in Central GST (which may not necessarily be at the same rate as the prevailing excise duty rate). Second, even the Additional Duties of Customs (commonly referred to as CVD and SAD) levied by the Central Government on imports are likely to be replaced with import GST. The import GST would also follow the dual GST principle, i.e., it would be split between Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST). Since some of the incentives offered under the FTP for physical and deemed exports are also linked to customs and excise duty, the Ministry of Commerce would need to revisit the policy to ensure that the incentives continue to be relevant under GST. For instance, exporters are entitled to claim a refund (example, drawback) of the duties paid on inputs used in manufacture of export products. Refund is also available for duties paid on certain supplies of finished goods, which qualify as deemed exports (supply of equipment to mega power projects, for instance). Not only the quantum of incentives, but also the export obligation attached to some of the incentive schemes (such as EPCG) is linked to the quantum of duty saved. Under GST, on account of change in tax rates, companies utilising incentives under FTP could witness a change in their cash-flows/export obligation. Apart from change in tax rate, another aspect that merits consideration is the impact of replacement of excise duty (being a single point levy) with CGST (being a multiple point levy). Take, for instance, the ‘refund of terminal excise duty' available to certain categories of deemed exports (supplies to EOUs, for example). The refund is available to the manufacturer, even if the manufactured goods are supplied to specified projects through intermediaries, and not directly by such manufacturer. Going forward, since excise duty would be replaced by CGST, is it fair to expect the Commerce Ministry to extend the refund to the CGST paid by intermediaries on their margins? Replacement of CVD and SAD with import GST would also impact the provisions under the FTP. For instance, it is not clear as to whether the drawback benefit would be confined to only the CGST component of import GST, or would it also extend to SGST. Also, consider the deemed export benefits available for ‘supply of goods to any project or purpose in respect of which the MoF, by a notification, permits import of such goods at zero customs duty'. It remains to be seen whether goods exempt from CGST, but liable to SGST for any reason whatsoever, would also be eligible for this benefit. Clearing house Such issues could arise primarily because while SGST is a State subject, FTP is regulated by a different agency i.e., the Central Government, through the Commerce Ministry. Therefore, it may not be viable for the Central Government to grant refund (or drawback) for the SGST which has been collected by the State Governments. However, to make things simpler for exporters, the Central Government may consider a clearing house model similar to that proposed for inter-State supplies (IGST), where the entire amount of import GST, including SGST, can be refunded by the Central Government to the exporter in the form of drawback. The Central Government, in turn, can recover the SGST from the respective State Governments. As the policy also governs various special category units and supplies (such as EOUs, STPs, etc.), realignment would also be required in order to capture the impact of GST. For example, if the supplies to EOUs are not zero-rated (which cannot be ruled out, as the discussion paper issued by the Empowered Committee is silent on this aspect), then the clauses in the FTP which prescribe duty exemptions for such supplies would need to be suitably reworded. Then there are some procedural aspects as well. For example, the procedure for claiming drawback under the FTP is currently linked to the rules prescribed under the excise laws. Once the excise duty is subsumed into GST, the FTP would need to be made a self-contained document with all relevant procedures currently prescribed under different laws, including excise. To conclude, the far reaching impact of GST needs to be appreciated well in time, to ensure that all other legislation/policy documents impacted by this change are appropriately amended. Thus, in the context of FTP, it may be worthwhile for all interested parties (such as exporters, deemed export suppliers, etc.) to analyse the potential impact of GST, and voice their concerns before the relevant agencies. After all, it would require concerted efforts from all stakeholders to make this momentous transition a real success. – www.thehindubusinessline.com "

Quora Sign In Instant Coffee Tax Policy of India Goods and Services Tax India (GST) Coffee The Economy of India Tax Policy Taxes What is the impact of GST on commodity exporters from India? Comments on Green and Instant coffee exports in particular would be welcome Update Cancel Answer Wiki 2 Answers Santosh H Raghavendra , Senior Product Manager Answered 67w ago Impact on Importers and Exporters: To promote exports from India, governments at both centre and state have provided various exemptions and incentives to exporters under the current indirect tax regime. The export-linked tax incentives extended under the Foreign Trade Promotion include the Schemes namely; Served from India Scheme ('SFIS'), Focus Product Scheme ('FPS'), Focus Market Scheme ('FMS'), Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme ('EPCG'), Establishment of Export Oriented Units ('EOU'), Special Economic Zones ('SEZ'), Foreign Trade & Warehouses Zones ('FTWZ'), etc. The tax incentives extended under the FTP principally consist of exemption from Central levies such as Central Excise duty, Customs duty, Central Sales tax, etc. Zero rating of exports under GST ensures that Indian exports continue to be competitive in international market. This would also result in inverted duty structure as inputs or imports are taxed while exports are zero rated leading to accumulation of Input credit which has to be regularly claimed for refunds. Current indirect tax regime provides for lower or no customs duty on imports for importers who use them in producing goods that are subsequently exported. However under GST, imports would be subject to IGST (CGST + SGST) and any exemptions or additional levy will not exist. This would provide level playing field for domestic manufacturers vis-à-vis importers. The major import gaining sectors after implementation of GST would be leather and leather products, furniture and fixtures, agricultural sectors, coal & lignite, agricultural machinery, industrial machinery, other machinery, iron & steel, railway transport equipment, printing and publishing and tobacco products. Moderate gainers would be metal products; non-ferrous metals; and transport equipment other than railways. Imports are expected to decline in textiles and readymade garments; minerals other than coal, crude petroleum, gas and iron ore; and beverages. In case of SEZ, the various exemptions provided under different schemes would be limited in their applicability to export duty only. Exports or Deemed Exports would be zero rated but sale to domestic tariff area would be taxable. Refunds would have to be claimed for accumulated ITC. Business Process: SEZ, EOU and other exporters’ registration would be appropriately identified such that any suppliers selling to them would be considered as deemed exports eliminating the need to obtain statutory (H) forms. With respect to return filing, in case of export of goods, there is time lag between date of invoice, physical export of goods and obtaining shipping bill. Hence GSTR 1 filing may get delayed till shipping details are obtained. Dealers who are 100% exporters will be required to obtain duty paid inputs and then claim refund based on exports. This leads to unnecessary blocking of working capital. Separate refund granting authorities and separate refund applications for SGST and CGST/IGST refunds is not a good practice under GST. The interest rate for delayed payments by assessee is at 18% while for delays by tax authorities the applicable rate is 6%. Since BRC is mandatory for claiming refunds on ITC accumulated due to exports the entire process gets delayed as payment is done at a later date subsequent to export.

In the current tax regime, laws of Customs duty, Excise, Service Tax and VAT lay down the tax treatment of imports and exports. In the GST regime, Excise, Service Tax and VAT will be subsumed into GST and customs duty will continue to be levied separately. Let us understand the tax implication on imports and exports under GST in comparison to the current regime. Current Regime Import of goods In the current regime, a person who imports goods has to pay customs duty, countervailing duty (CVD), and special additional duty (SAD). CVD is levied at a rate equivalent to the rate of Excise on such goods, if they had been manufactured in India. SAD is equivalent to VAT on the goods in India. CVD and SAD are imposed to bring the imported product’s price to its true market price in India. If the importer uses the imported goods to manufacture dutiable goods in India or provide taxable services, CVD paid on inputs is available as tax credit. If the importer is just a trader, CVD on imports is not available as credit. SAD paid on import is eligible for refund, subject to conditions. However, no credit is given on customs duty paid and it becomes a cost for the importer. Let us see an example to understand the levy of import duties in case of import of goods in the current regime. Example: Manoj Apparel in Bangalore, Karnataka purchases apparel from a supplier, Oz Designs, in Sydney, Australia. Tax calculation Particulars Nos. Price per no. (Rs.) Amount(Rs.) Women’s T-shirts 200 2,500 (51.68 AUD) * 5,00,000 Men’s T-shirts 100 5,000 (103.37 AUD) * 5,00,000 Total 300 – 10,00,000 Customs duty @ 10% 1,00,000 Customs education cess @ 3% on customs duty (1,00,000*3%) 3,000 Sub total 11, 03,000 CVD @ 12.5% 1,37,875 Sub total 12,40,875 SAD @ 4% 49,635 Total cost of import 12,90,510 * Exchange rate taken is 0.021 AUD = 1 Rupee Import of services A person who imports services has to pay Service Tax on the imported service at the Service tax rate applicable in India. The importer can claim tax credit of the Service Tax paid on imports. For example: Rajesh Apparels in Hyderabad, Telengana, avails fashion designing services of Rs. 50,00,000 from Kaushi Designs in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Tax calculation Particulars Amount (Rs.) Fashion designing services 50,00,000 Service Tax @14% 7,00,000 Krishi Kalyan Cess @0.5% 25,000 Swachh Bharat Cess @0.5% 25,000 Total cost of import 57,50,000 Exports In the current regime, export of goods and services is zero rated, i.e. rate of tax on exports is 0%. An exporter can also claim refund of the tax paid on inputs used to manufacture/purchase/provide the exported goods or services. GST Regime Import of goods In the GST regime, a person who imports goods has to pay customs duty and IGST. The difference here is that CVD and SAD levied on imports in the current regime will be replaced by IGST under GST. IGST will be levied at the rate applicable to the imported goods in India. An importer can claim full tax credit of IGST paid on imports. Hence, importers who were unable to claim credit of CVD or SAD in the current regime can now claim full tax credit of the IGST paid on imports. However, no tax credit will be given on customs duty paid and it remains a cost for the importer under GST also. Let us take an example to understand the levy of import duties in case of import of goods in the GST regime. Example: Manoj Apparel in Bangalore, Karnataka purchases apparel from a supplier, Oz Designs, in Sydney, Australia. Tax calculation Particulars Nos. Price per no. (Rs.) Total Price (Rs.) Women’s T-shirts 200 2,500 (51.68 AUD) * 5,00,000 Men’s T-shirts 100 5,000 (103.37 AUD) * 5,00,000 Total 300 – 10,00,000 Customs duty @ 10% 1,00,000 Education cess @ 3% on customs duty (10,000*3%) 3,000 Sub total 11,03,000 IGST @18% ** 1,98,540 Total cost of import 13,01,540 * Exchange rate taken is 0.021 AUD = 1 Rupee **Assuming GST rate of 18% on apparel. Import of Services Under GST, a supply will be considered as an import of service when- The supplier of the service is located outside India. The recipient of the service is located in India and The place of supply of the service is in India. For example: Rajesh Apparels in Hyderabad, Telengana, avails fashion designing services of INR 50,00,000 from Kaushi Designs in Colombo, Sri Lanka Location of supplier: Colombo, Sri Lanka Location of recipient: Hyderabad, Telengana Place of supply: Place of supply will be the location of the recipient, i.e. Hyderabad, Telengana. Hence, this supply is an import. Tax calculation Particulars Amount (Rs.) Fashion designing services 50,00,000 IGST @ 18%* 9,00,000 Total cost of import 59,00,000 * Assuming GST rate of 18% on fashion designing services Exports Under GST, exports will be zero rated, similar to the current regime. An exporter can also claim refund of the tax paid on inputs used to manufacture/purchase/provide the exported goods or services. Export of services Specific conditions have been laid down for a supply to be considered an export of service under GST. These are: The supplier of the service is located in India. The recipient of the service is located outside India. The place of supply of the service is outside India The payment for the service has been received by the supplier in convertible foreign exchange and The supplier and recipient are not establishments of the same person. For example: Rohan Consultants in Mumbai, Maharashtra, provides business consultancy services to Abey’s Engineering in Singapore. The payment for the service has been received in Singapore Dollars. Here, Location of supplier: Mumbai, Maharashtra Location of recipient: Singapore Place of supply: Place of supply will be the location of the recipient, i.e. Singapore. Payment for the service: Payment for the service has been received in convertible foreign exchange, i.e. Singapore Dollars. Relationship between the supplier and recipient: The supplier and recipient are distinct persons. Hence, this supply qualifies as an export of service. Rate of tax on the supply will be 0%. The levy of taxes and treatment of taxes in case of imports and exports largely remain the same under GST in comparison with the existing laws. In case of an importer, full input credit will be available on the IGST paid on imports and additional input credit will be available on the GST paid on all types of inputs used or intended to be used in the course of or for the furtherance of business. Similarly, in the case of an exporter, refund will be given on the tax paid on all inputs used in the course of business. Overall, costs of import and export are expected to reduce under GST and compliance is expected to become easier with the convergence of multiple tax laws into one law.

I have one clarification after reading your article and looking into the examples. Does it mean that both importers of items and services total tax will be higher than before when GST is introduced ??? I prefer to re-introduce what Singapore and Hong Long had practiced and became world leaders in finances plus economic hubs just having simple one 15 % taxation for both import, export and on investments. I am preparing an article on how to make it happen using latest IT and integrated card system for both India my Father Land and my Mother Land Myanmar and willing to share with who ever may be interest to review it. Your reply will be highly appreciated. Best wishes and regards, Dr Win Reply Tally Solutions says: Wednesday April 26th, 2017 at 03:46 PM Under GST, the total tax on import will remain similar to the tax in the current regime. However, availability of full input credit of IGST on import will reduce the cost of import.

This post is re-published with permission from Tally Solutions Sharing is Fun! Facebook 0 Twitter 0 LinkedIn 0 Taxation laws have laid down the taxes applicable on import and export of goods and services. In the current tax regime, laws of Customs duty, Excise, Service Tax and VAT lay down the tax treatment of imports and exports. In the GST regime, Excise, Service Tax and VAT will be subsumed into GST and customs duty will continue to be levied separately. Let us understand the tax implication on imports and exports under GST in comparison to the current regime. Current Regime Import of goods In the current regime, a person who imports goods has to pay customs duty, countervailing duty (CVD), and special additional duty (SAD). CVD is levied at a rate equivalent to the rate of Excise on such goods, if they had been manufactured in India. SAD is equivalent to VAT on the goods in India. CVD and SAD are imposed to bring the imported product’s price to its true market price in India. If the importer uses the imported goods to manufacture dutiable goods in India or provide taxable services, CVD paid on inputs is available as tax credit. If the importer is just a trader, CVD on imports is not available as credit. SAD paid on import is eligible for refund, subject to conditions. However, no credit is given on customs duty paid and it becomes a cost for the importer. Let us see an example to understand the levy of import duties in case of import of goods in the current regime. Example: Manoj Apparel in Bangalore, Karnataka purchases apparel from a supplier, Oz Designs, in Sydney, Australia. Tax calculation Particulars Nos. Price per no. (Rs.) Amount(Rs.) Women’s T-shirts 200 2,500 (51.68 AUD) * 5,00,000 Men’s T-shirts 100 5,000 (103.37 AUD) * 5,00,000 Total 300 – 10,00,000 Customs duty @ 10% 10,000 Customs education cess @ 3% on customs duty (10,000*3%) 300 Sub total 10,10,300 CVD @ 12.5% 1,26,288 Sub total 11,36,588 SAD @ 4% 45,464 Total cost of import 11,82,052 * Exchange rate taken is 0.021 AUD = 1 Rupee Import of services A person who imports services has to pay Service Tax on the imported service at the Service tax rate applicable in India. The importer can claim tax credit of the Service Tax paid on imports. For example: Rajesh Apparels in Hyderabad, Telengana, avails fashion designing services of Rs. 50,00,000 from Kaushi Designs in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Tax calculation Particulars Amount (Rs.) Fashion designing services 50,00,000 Service Tax @14% 7,00,000 Krishi Kalyan Cess @0.5% 25,000 Swachh Bharat Cess @0.5% 25,000 Total cost of import 57,50,000 Exports In the current regime, export of goods and services is zero rated, i.e. rate of tax on exports is 0%. An exporter can also claim refund of the tax paid on inputs used to manufacture/purchase/provide the exported goods or services. GST Regime Import of goods In the GST regime, a person who imports goods has to pay customs duty and IGST. The difference here is that CVD and SAD levied on imports in the current regime will be replaced by IGST under GST. IGST will be levied at the rate applicable to the imported goods in India. An importer can claim full tax credit of IGST paid on imports. Hence, importers who were unable to claim credit of CVD or SAD in the current regime can now claim full tax credit of the IGST paid on imports. However, no tax credit will be given on customs duty paid and it remains a cost for the importer under GST also. Let us take an example to understand the levy of import duties in case of import of goods in the GST regime. Example: Manoj Apparel in Bangalore, Karnataka purchases apparel from a supplier, Oz Designs, in Sydney, Australia. Tax calculation Particulars Nos. Price per no. (Rs.) Total Price (Rs.) Women’s T-shirts 200 2,500 (51.68 AUD) * 5,00,000 Men’s T-shirts 100 5,000 (103.37 AUD) * 5,00,000 Total 300 – 10,00,000 Customs duty @ 10% 10,000 Education cess @ 3% on customs duty (10,000*3%) 300 Sub total 10,10,300 IGST @18% ** 1,81,854 Total cost of import 11,92, 154 * Exchange rate taken is 0.021 AUD = 1 Rupee **Assuming GST rate of 18% on apparel. Import of Services Under GST, a supply will be considered as an import of service when- The supplier of the service is located outside India. The recipient of the service is located in India and The place of supply of the service is in India. For example: Rajesh Apparels in Hyderabad, Telengana, avails fashion designing services of INR 50,00,000 from Kaushi Designs in Colombo, Sri Lanka Location of supplier: Colombo, Sri Lanka Location of recipient: Hyderabad, Telengana Place of supply: Place of supply will be the location of the recipient, i.e. Hyderabad, Telengana. Hence, this supply is an import. Tax calculation Particulars Amount (Rs.) Fashion designing services 50,00,000 IGST @ 18%* 9,00,000 Total cost of import 59,00,000 * Assuming GST rate of 18% on fashion designing services Exports Under GST, exports will be zero rated, similar to the current regime. An exporter can also claim refund of the tax paid on inputs used to manufacture/purchase/provide the exported goods or services. Export of services Specific conditions have been laid down for a supply to be considered an export of service under GST. These are: The supplier of the service is located in India. The recipient of the service is located outside India. The place of supply of the service is outside India The payment for the service has been received by the supplier in convertible foreign exchange and The supplier and recipient are not establishments of the same person. For example: Rohan Consultants in Mumbai, Maharashtra, provides business consultancy services to Abey’s Engineering in Singapore. The payment for the service has been received in Singapore Dollars. Here, Location of supplier: Mumbai, Maharashtra Location of recipient: Singapore Place of supply: Place of supply will be the location of the recipient, i.e. Singapore. Payment for the service: Payment for the service has been received in convertible foreign exchange, i.e. Singapore Dollars. Relationship between the supplier and recipient: The supplier and recipient are distinct persons. Hence, this supply qualifies as an export of service. Rate of tax on the supply will be 0%. The levy of taxes and treatment of taxes in case of imports and exports largely remain the same under GST in comparison with the existing laws. In case of an importer, full input credit will be available on the IGST paid on imports and additional input credit will be available on the GST paid on all types of inputs used or intended to be used in the course of or for the furtherance of business. Similarly, in the case of an exporter, refund will be given on the tax paid on all inputs used in the course of business. Overall, costs of import and export are expected to reduce under GST and compliance is expected to become easier with the convergence of multiple tax laws into one law.

49," Register for GST Certification Course | GST Experts Need Help? Sign Up Log in Export Growth In GST Regime Category: GST Tags: GST 5/29/2017 (IST) I n the existing Indirect tax system and upcoming GST regime there has been a lot of changes in the different aspects of goods and services but in all these the one which is least affected is the ‘Export’ of India. Under current regulations, most goods can be organized for export by simply paying its export duty, where applicable, and without obtaining a license. It is only if items are listed in Schedule 2 of the Indian Trade Classification (ITC) Harmonized System (HS) that a company will either need to obtain the relevant license, or be unable to export the product at all. Products listed in Schedule 2 of the ITC (HS) will either be restricted or prohibited. Restricted goods become available for export once a company has obtained the appropriate license. After the GST implementation , exporters will be able to capitalize on the refunds and rebates from the taxes which will come under the ambit of state taxes (SGST) . The refund and rebate on the export of services is likely to be increased substantially after the GST rates are applied. To make the refunds easier, government has ensured that all the relevant data on GST rates will be available online which tends to do away with the verification of documents. A large number of organizations are actively looking for ERP systems that are GST compliant and will provide them competitive benefits. Present refund mechanism involves filing of bulk sets of export documents; thereby involving a sheer wastage of time, money and energy. The division offices are burdened with tons of papers which are to be preserved for no use in future. Also, it is said that it is feasible for exporters to keep a dedicated person for doing photocopies of export documents. So, now this saying will say good bye in the GST era as under GST , there will be least filing of documents for the purpose of export as most of the filing will be online. Following are the key features of newly proposed refund mechanism applicable to exporters under GST era:- In IGST Model , there is proposal of online filing details of invoice wise sale/purchase along with the monthly returns to GST network (GSTN). These details will be linked to customs network (ICEGATE). Thus, the details of basic export documents like invoice no., packing list, etc. as submitted to GSTN can be verified with those available at ICEGATE. Thus, there would be no need of submitting the same manually. The refund application will be submitted online within the time prescribed under GST law which is proposed as one year from relevant date. Definition of relevant date is to be prescribed by GST law. The receipt and bill of lading are the crucial documents evidencing the factum of export. Thus, the scanned copies of mate’s receipt and bill of lading will be submitted along with the refund application. Bank realization certificate (BRC) may not be available at the time of filing the refund application; thus, the same shall be submitted subsequently to GSTN. There will be inbuilt feature in the GSTN to track those export invoices in respect of which BRC has not been submitted within due time. This feature will send alert to respective officer for taking the appropriate action. The time limit for granting refund has been fixed as three months from the date of filing of application. There shall be inbuilt feature in GSTN to link the refund sanctioned with blocking of carry forward of input tax credit in the return/cash ledger. Thus, double benefit could not be taken by the exporters. In case of export of service, only two documents are available - invoice and BRC . Further, no data is available on the ICEGATE also. Therefore, the refund in case of export of service shall be filed manually after the realization of export proceeds. In GST regime exports are proposed to be zero rated , i.e. the export goods will not suffer any actual tax liability although the inputs for them would be tax paid which would subsequently be neutralized. Exports will be treated as inter-state supply of goods, thus, IGST will be paid by the tax payer in case the tax is paid at the time of export . This IGST can be claimed as refund by following the procedure detailed as above. The government is re-designing the export benefit scheme MEIS to make it GST-compliant . Under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) , the commerce ministry gives duty benefits to several products. It provides duty benefits at 2 %, 3 % and 5 % depending upon the product and country. After the GST is put into effect , there will be zero rating of export leading to an inverted tax sructure which will prove beneficial. As a result input credit will be accumilated and then can be claimed for regular refund . Thus manufactures will be placed at par with importers. Although, evaluation of the impact of GST on exporters and indigenous traders is yet to be conclusively made, unarguably, the new tax structure will enhance the competitiveness of Indian export. On the whole, the GST will ensure that the process of getting tax incentives is streamlined and made easier for the stakeholders. In addition, the GST is also likely to expedite the process of getting various refunds for exporters, thereby boosting the overall economy of the nation.

Introduction India has always followed an export policy that ""Export the Goods, not the taxes."" This is quite logical if India has to compete on the International Level especially with China who manufactures and supplies cheapest goods all over the world. Exports play a vital role in Indian economy. Exports bring in the precious foreign currency in India which helps it sustain the balance of Trade. Balance of trade is a difference in value between a country's imports and exports. Balance of trade is the largest factor contributing towards the Current Account Deficit (CAD) . Current Account Deficit (CAD) Current Account Deficit is a situation when nation's value of imports is greater than the value of exports. It is calculated in terms of percentage to GDP. Any percentage of more than 5% of GDP will have a negative impact on the economy as the difference will have to finance either by borrowing or by inviting capital investment. Here are some of the outlined points on Current Account Deficit: 1. A developing nation like India often witnesses the current account Deficit, this is mainly due to the lack of technology and proper infrastructure. 2. If deficit is financed by borrowing, then country will have more chances to fall under debt trap. As in the long term, country will be burdened with high Interest payments and if it does not generate enough cash flow to repay the debt, then it tends to take more debt to repay the existing one and the cycle continues. 3. If deficit is financed by Foreign Direct Investment (as in the case of India), then also, it is considered as harmful in the longer run. In this case, countries growth somehow depends upon the investor confidence. If any time, country fails to attract the investment, it could lead to severe consequences. Also, a lot of money will then be taken by the foreign company in the form of outbound investment or dividends in the longer run. India's position India is growing at a robust pace. Currently, India is the fastest growing economy in the world surpassing China. Hence, it is expected that India will run a Current Account Deficit which is adjusted with the capital account receipts like FDI. The biggest contributor to the CAD turmoil is the import of crude oil and gold. India's CAD has been narrowed to the eight years low since 2008 to 1.2% of the GDP. This is mainly due to fall in process of crude oil. Once, the crude oil will start bouncing back, the import bill will again take up its shape and so will the current account deficit. India has already placed many barriers to discourage the imports; however India has to import the goods, oil, gold etc to meet its domestic demand. Hence, it is better to increase the export to curtail the effect of rising crude oil on the current account deficit. GST a boon for Exports The government of India is very keen on improving the export infrastructure and export incentives to lavish the Indian and foreign players to invest in India, manufacture in India and sell anywhere. This was the idea to improve the exports from India. India aims to raise the manufacturing sector contribution to GDP to 25% from existing 16%. As said, to achieve the ambitious target, GST will play a vital role. GST will proposed to remove the web of tax laws, unnecessary litigations, cascading effect, no proper refund mechanism of input tax on all types of export and further. Hence, it would be easier for the government to manage a single tax rather than the multiplicity of taxes. Some of the points are mentioned below; Cost advantage via GST: Once GST is implemented the refund of input taxes would be granted, further the cascading effect will also be removed. This would reduce the most of production and will offer the cost advantage on global level which would ultimately boost the exports. Single Tax to Manage: It would be better for government and the industry to manage the single tax rather than multiple tax laws. This will increase compliance to the law and invite lesser interest and penalties. Further, it will also create an environment of trust where things will be clearer and settled which will bring in more investment to boost industrial output and hence ultimately increases export. Lesser Litigation: A business man never wants to indulge in the dispute or legal cases, especially with the government over the tax laws. Further, it has been observed that most of the legal cases happen due to lack of awareness about the laws. Since, GST will be a single indirect tax law, then it would surely enhance legal friendly environment. Stronger Domestic Market: GST would directly bring in the ease of doing business with the entrepreneur. Hence, once more new business will come into market and ultimately strengthen the domestic supply helping India reduce the imports or even increase the exports. Support to Make in India: There is no doubt that GST will support the make in India campaign. Prime Minister Modi said sell anywhere but make in India. GST with its many advantages will bring in more foreign investment and will help India to become an export hub as desired. At last we can say that GST will have a far-reaching positive impact on exports. Conclusion Everyone must know the impact of GST from macroeconomic point of view.

51," Impact of GST in Import and Export Menu Home About GST Knowledge Blog Mobile APP Newsletter Downloads Our Services Impact of GST on Import and Export Posted on September 21, 2015 January 6, 2016 by onlineGST.in India is the seventh largest economy in the world. It is the world’s fastest growing economy preceding the major economy of China. The basic tool to evaluate the growth of any country is Balance of Payment (BOP), which comprises the transactions in the Capital account, Current account and the reserves. Trade is considered as an important determinant of the economical growth. It becomes necessary to keep an eye on the trade performance of India in the domestic market as well as in the International market. Growth in Import & Export is favorable for a healthy economy internationally. It depicts the growing domestic demand and strengthening of the currency. However, India various duties levied increase overall value to the Indian Importers & Exporters and decrease the competitiveness in the market. Several schemes have been introduced to promote trade activities and simplifying the procedural chaos. The new proposed bill in the constitution for introducing compliance is GST. GST (Goods and Services Tax) is the main agenda of the government at the moment. GST, if Implemented in an empirical way will suspend the taxation web and thus secure the loss of tax credit and compliance at different levels.GST is believed to be the revolutionary regime in the history of Indian taxation system. Implementation of the bill is going to be an event of speculation for almost every Industry in India. A mandatory constitutional amendment has to be made for levying GST on Imports. It has been proposed that merchandise Imports coming to India will face GST on destination criteria. Duty levied under GST for Import in services will be based on reverse charge method. Indian has signed several trade agreements under which Imports coming from such partner countries are not liable to pay Import duty but with the implementation of GST they will be subjected to CGST and SGST having a national treatment. Exports would be relieved of the burden of GST by zero rating. As of now, In Foreign trade policy exports enjoy tax exemption at state as well as central level also government have given various incentives for export promotion. Under GST structure Centre and States will separately administer a CGST and SGST respectively. It is known that CGST will subsume Central Excise duty, Service tax and the Additional Customs duties and for State, SGST will subsume VAT and perhaps also Entry tax (at the State level) and other taxes but export duty would not be subsumed. It is probable that service sectors would be required to file multiple refund claims for SGST element in every State, leading to increase in compliance cost and hardships. Moreover, increase in rates would lead to higher accumulation of credits and consequent impact on Company’s cash flows. Government has to re-evaluate the relative schemes meant for the recovery or exemption of taxes on inputs. The Government must integrate FTP with the ‘Make in India’ agenda. The Government should rationalize the inverted duty structure. There is a ray of hope for every Industry if GST comes in practice. Hope it comes as good and great tax system. —— Team onlineGST.in This entry was posted in Impact of GST and tagged export , GST , GST in India , impact of gst , import . Bookmark the permalink .

GST – Current Taxes to be Subsumed Impact of GST on Pharmaceuticals ? 24 thoughts on “ Impact of GST on Import and Export ” RAMAKRISHNAN S. says: August 5, 2016 at 11:43 pm Please let me known GST implement SAD will not applicable for import trader so they need not to claim SAD and what would be Branch transfer? whether the it will taxable? if taxable who will get the INPUT on the tax? Reply onlineGST.in says: August 6, 2016 at 10:54 am the SAD will be subsumed under the Goods and Services Tax. Branch transfer will be taxable. Please see http://www.onlinegst.in/import-and-export-under-proposed-gst/ Reply Jatin says: August 7, 2016 at 10:19 am I believe that Imported Goods will become cheaper with Basic Custom Duty and IGST being levied upon it. Importers can pass on the IGST Input Credit. Unlike earlier where it was charged with BCD + CVD + SAD(though refunded). This goes against the Make in India Concept. Non levy of CVD on Imports would hamper the manufacturers in India as they would lose as compared to the Importers. Reply Abdul latheef says: September 2, 2016 at 11:12 pm Whether reverse is payable on import of goods n services for own use in gst scenario? Reply onlineGST.in says: September 4, 2016 at 11:53 pm A supply of goods and/or services in the course of import into the territory of India shall be deemed to be a supply of goods and/or services in the course of inter-State trade or commerce. The Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) shall be paid by every taxable person in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Further, the Central Government may, on recommendation of the Council, by notification, specify categories of supply of goods and/or services the tax on which is payable on reverse charge basis. Hence, the list of items is to be recommended by the GST Counsel. Further, it needs to be considered that as per Sec 9 of Model CGST Law, any person receiving services of value not exceeding ______ rupees in a year for personal use, shall be regarded as taxable person. However the limit is yet to be decided. Reply subramanya says: September 7, 2016 at 4:27 pm Due to GST, is duty drawback will be removed for EXPORTS Reply Jay says: September 17, 2016 at 12:26 pm Will Imported Goods become cheaper after GST ? Reply onlineGST.in says: September 17, 2016 at 5:09 pm IMPORT DUTY: Current State: Central Government levy taxes when an article or thing is brought into its territorial limits. The duty is called Basic Custom Duty. It is the tax charged on imports. Along with Basic Custom duty, Countervailing Duties u/s 3(1) and 3(5) are also charged to compensate for the losses of Excise Duties and Sales Taxes as had the goods not been imported, the same had to be manufactured in India giving revenues to the Government in form of Excise and Sales Tax. Proposed GST regime: Basic Customs Duty will continue to be levied even after the implementation of GST. However, the additional customs duty in the name of CVD u/s 3(1) and CVD u/s 3(5) will be subsumed in the import GST. IMPORT OF SERVICE: Current State: Under existing provisions of Service Tax Laws, where any person (subject to Entry no. 34 of Mega Exemption) imports the service in Taxable Territory, he is liable to pay service tax under reverse charge mechanism. Taxable event is decided as per Rule 7 of Point of Taxation. Proposed GST regime: Under proposed GST regime, the import of services will be subject to Central GST and State GST on a reverse charge mechanism and the same will be payable by the Importer on a self-declaration basis. Place of supply rules will determine which state will have the authority to get the tax. However, the taxes so paid will be available as Input Tax Credit and therefore, it would be a revenue neutral. Reply Pushpendra Sharma says: October 23, 2016 at 10:50 am Under the GST How much taxes on imported are to be charged against the following Present structure: 10% BCD + 12.5 CVD + 2% E.CESS + 1% SHE CESS + 4% S.AD. = 29.5% Custo Duty 15.5% UP VAT Thus total Taxes: Custom Duty + UP VAT = 45% After GST how much total taxes shall be charged against 45% as above. Reply onlineGST.in says: October 24, 2016 at 9:20 pm Under GST Regime, BCD is continue to be charged. The GST rate structure is still to be finalised by the GST Council.

Reply onlineGST.in says: February 19, 2017 at 12:45 pm Yes the manufacturer can avail such credit on issuance of Invoice or Purchase Return Reply Milind Kumbhar says: April 3, 2017 at 6:21 pm In GST Regime, exports are exempted. However there is a requirement in tax return filing (GSTR -1) table 11 under head “Supplies Exported”. There are relevent columns given in this table asking details of taxes (CGST, SGST, IGST). If there is no GST on exports, what would be the details required to be shown as CGST , SGST and IGST. Please explain and guide Reply onlineGST.in says: April 8, 2017 at 1:35 pm As per section 16 of IGST Law: A registered taxable person exporting goods or services shall be eligible to claim refund under one of the following two options, namely – (a) a registered taxable person may export goods or services under bond, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as may be prescribed in this regard, without payment of IGST and claim refund of unutilized input tax credit in accordance with provisions of section 48 of the CGST Act, 2016 read with rules made thereunder; (b) a registered taxable person may export goods or services, subject to such conditions, safeguards and procedure as may be prescribed in this regard, on payment of IGST and claim refund of IGST paid on goods and services exported in accordance with provisions of section 48 of the CGST Act, 2016 read with rules made thereunder.
