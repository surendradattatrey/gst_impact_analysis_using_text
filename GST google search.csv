Home > Services > Being GST Compliant Being GST Compliant Share A tax trigger aimed to replace the current complex structure of multiple indirect taxes in favour of a comprehensive dual Goods and Services Tax (GST) is becoming a reality soon. With clear road map being laid down by the Finance Ministry, the Government seems on course to fast track the entire process to achieve targeted GST implementation effective 1 July 2017. On 12 April 2017, the Central Government enacted four GST Bills: Central GST (CGST) Integrated GST (IGST) Union Territory GST (UTGST) Bill to Compensate States Till date, more than half the states have passed the State GST (SGST) law in the respective State assemblies, while other States are expected to do it by end of May 2017. Union territories with legislature, i.e., Delhi & Puducherry, will adopt SGST Act and the balance 5 Union territories without legislatures will adopt UTGST Act. The enrolment process for migrating existing taxpayers to the proposed tax regime through GST common portal have already commenced. GST Network, an IT backbone of GST, will soon carry out the test run of its Portal. The GST Council consisting of representatives from the Central as well as state Government, met on fourteen occasions in last six months and cleared - GST laws, GST Rules, Tax rate structure including Compensation Cess, Classification of goods and services into different rate slabs, Exemptions, Thresholds, Tax administration Back to Top Run-up to GST About 12 States and Union Territories have to pass State GST Law / Union Territory GST Law which is expected to be done by end of May 2017. GST Council has scheduled its next meeting on 3 June 2017 to finalise GST rates on gold, textile and few other products and also approve two draft rules duly vetted by legal team. Government has set up 10 working groups to iron out sectorial issues faced by trade and industry to ensure smooth transition to GST. Sectors include banking, telecom, IT/ITES, financial, textile, oil and gas, gems and jewellery, transport and logistics, and Small and medium enterprises. Enrolment process for migrating the existing tax payers will re-commence from 1 June 2017 Test run of GST Network is expected to commence shortly.

GST is expected to be a destination-based tax that should replace the current Central taxes and duties such as Excise Duty, Service Tax, Counter Veiling Duty (CVD), Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD), central charges and cesses and local state taxes, i.e., Value Added Tax (VAT), Central Sales Tax (CST), Octroi, Entry Tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury Tax, state cesses and surcharges and Entertainment tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies). It will be a dual levy with State/Union territory GST and Central GST. Moreover, inter–state supplies would attract an Integrated GST, which would be the sum total of CGST and SGST/UTGST. Petroleum products, i.e., petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit, aviation turbine fuel, natural gas will be brought under the ambit of GST from such date as may be notified by the Government on recommendation of the Council. Alcohol for human consumption has been kept outside the purview of GST. A well-designed GST in India is expected to simplify and rationalize the current indirect tax regime, eliminate tax cascading and put the Indian economy on high-growth trajectory. The proposed GST levy may potentially impact both manufacturing and services sector for the entire value chain of operations, namely procurement, manufacturing, distribution, warehousing, sales, and pricing. EY Advantage Policy advocacy EY has been closely involved with the GST initiative through its Policy Advisory Group - it comprises a specialized team of experienced professionals, including former government officials who advise businesses as well as governments on diverse policy issues.

Business Impact Benefits of GST GST has been envisaged as a more efficient tax system, neutral in its application and attractive in distribution. The advantages of GST are: Wider tax base, necessary for lowering the tax rates and eliminating classification disputes Elimination of multiplicity of taxes and their cascading effects Rationalization of tax structure and simplification of compliance procedures Harmonization of center and State tax administrations, which would reduce duplication and compliance costs Automation of compliance procedures to reduce errors and increase efficiency Destination principle The GST structure would follow the destination principle. Accordingly, imports would be subject to GST, while exports would be zero-rated. In the case of inter-State transactions within India, the State tax would apply in the State of destination as opposed to that of origin. Taxes to be subsumed GST would replace most indirect taxes currently in place such as: Central Taxes State Taxes Central Excise Duty [including additional excise duties, excise duty under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations (Excise Duties) Act, 1955] Service tax Additional Customs Duty (CVD) Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD) Central Sales Tax ( levied by the Centre and collected by the States) Central surcharges and cesses ( relating to supply of goods and services) Value Added Tax Octroi and Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Taxes on lottery, betting & gambling State cesses and surcharges Entertainment tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies) Central Sales Tax ( levied by the Centre and collected by the States) Key imperatives for companies The key imperatives for companies are: With the proposed implementation of GST from 1 July 2017 gaining intensity, it is critical for industry: to understand the broad contours and framework of the proposed GST law, likely impact of the new levy on the business, take appropriate steps to undertake necessary changes in business processes, assess financial impact, frame pricing strategy, align internal organization and IT systems and Be GST ready. ‹ › ‹ › ‹ › ‹ › ‹ › ‹ › Know more about our EY GST professionals EY GST Navigator Our EY proprietary tool with state-of-the-art technology will help you assess and simulate tax impact in the GST environment.

[1] It may also be a credit granted in recognition of taxes already paid or, as in the United Kingdom , a form of state support for low earners. Incentive tax credits may be used to encourage behaviors like investment or parenting . A credit directly reduces tax bills, unlike tax deductions and tax exemptions , which indirectly reduce tax bills by reducing the size of the base (for example, a taxpayer's income or property value) from which the tax bill is calculated. Most tax credits are nonrefundable tax credits and so do not apply if no taxes are owed. However, some tax credits are refundable tax credits [2] so if the credit exceeds the amount of taxes owed, the excess is returned to the taxpayer. Contents 1 Credit for payments 2 Individual income tax credits 2.1 Low income subsidies 2.1.1 United Kingdom 2.1.2 United States 2.2 Family relief 2.3 Education, energy and other subsidies 3 Business tax credits 3.1 United States 3.1.1 Federal nonrefundable investment tax credits 3.1.2 Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit 3.1.3 Renewable Energy/Investment Tax Credit (ITC) 3.1.3.1 Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC) 3.1.3.2 Low Income (Affordable) Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) 3.1.3.3 Qualified School Construction Bond (QSCB) 3.1.4 Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) 3.1.5 American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) 3.2 State tax credits 3.2.1 Oregon Residential Energy Tax Credit (RETC) 4 Value added tax 5 Foreign tax credit 6 Credits for alternative tax bases 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Credit for payments [ edit ] Many systems refer to taxes paid indirectly, such as taxes withheld by payers of income, as credits rather than prepayments. In such cases, the tax credit is invariably refundable. The most common forms of such amounts are payroll withholding of income tax or PAYE , withholding of tax at source on payments to nonresidents, and input credits for value added tax . Individual income tax credits [ edit ] Income tax systems often grant a variety of credits to individuals. These typically include credits available to all taxpayers as well as tax credits unique to individuals. Some credits may be offered for a single year only. Low income subsidies [ edit ] Several income tax systems provide income subsidies to lower income individuals by way of credit. These credits may be based on income, family status, work status, or other factors. Often such credits are refundable when total credits exceed tax liability. United Kingdom [ edit ] In the United Kingdom, the Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit are paid directly into the claimant's bank account or Post Office Card Account . In exceptional circumstances, these can be paid by cashcheque (sometimes called giro ) however payments may stop if account details are not provided. [3] A minimum level of Child Tax Credits is payable to all individuals or couples with children, up to a certain income limit. The actual amount of Child Tax Credits that a person may receive depends on these factors: the level of their income, the number of children they have, whether the children are receiving Disability Living Allowance and the education status of any children over 16. Working Tax Credit is paid to single low earners with or without children who are aged 25 or over and are working over 30 hours per week and also to couples without children, at least one of whom is over 25, provided that at least one of them is working for 30 hours a week. If the claimant has children they may claim Working Tax Credit from age 16 upward provided that they are working at least sixteen hours per week. [4] Tax Credits are capped which many sources claim affects the poorest families disproportionately. A survey by End Child Poverty estimated that roughly 1.5 million parents have reduced spending on basics like food and fuel. [5] According to Gavin Kelly of the Resolution Foundation , tax credits help raise living standards of low paid workers. He wrote in the New Statesman , ""Perhaps the biggest misconception is the voguish notion that if tax credits are cut, employers will somehow decide to offer pay rises to fill the gap. This is saloon-bar economics espoused by some on both left and right."" [6] On 15 September 2015, the House of Commons voted [7] to decrease Tax Credit thresholds, a law that came into effect on 6 April 2016. [8] Opponents claimed that it would harm those on low incomes. Simon Hopkins, Chief Executive of charity Turn2us commented ""Today's vote in the House of Commons will mean one thing for many of the poorest working families in the UK; they are going to get poorer. Tax credits are a vital source of income for those on a low wage and for many they make up a substantial portion of their monthly income. [9] The IFS supported the opposition view that the effects of the changes would disproportionately reduce the income of poor families, even taking into account reductions in income tax and an increase in the National Living Wage . [10] The government responded that the tax credit system had, for too long, been used to subsidise low pay and the changes would bring total expenditure on tax credits back down to more sustainable levels seen in 2007–08. [7] On 26 October 2015 the House of Lords supported a motion from Baroness Meacher delaying the imposition of the cuts until a new consideration of the effects could be made by the House of Commons. [11] United States [ edit ] The U.S. system grants the following low income tax credits: Earned income credit : this refundable credit is granted for a percentage of income earned by a low income individual. The credit is calculated and capped based on the number of qualifying children, if any. This credit is indexed for inflation and phased out for incomes above a certain amount. For 2013, the maximum credit was $6,044 for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. [12] Credit for the elderly and disabled: a nonrefundable credit up to $1,125. Retirement savings contribution credit: a nonrefundable credit of up to 50% for up to $2000 of contributions to qualified retirement savings plans, such as IRAs (including the Roth , SEP and IRA ), 401(k) / 403(b) / 457 plans and the Thrift Savings Plan ; phased out starting (for the 2014 tax year) at incomes above $18,000 for single returns, $27,000 for heads of household, and $36,000 for joint returns. [13] Mortgage interest credit: a nonrefundable credit that may be limited to $2,000, granted under specific mortgage programs. Premium tax credit : this refundable credit is provided to individuals and families who obtain healthcare insurance policies through a healthcare exchange , and whose income falls between 100% and 400% of the applicable federal poverty line . It was first introduced in the 2014 tax year. Family relief [ edit ] Some systems grant tax credits for families with children. These credits may be on a per child basis or as a credit for child care expenses. The U.S. system offers the following nonrefundable family related income tax credits (in addition to a tax deduction for each dependent child): Child credit : Parents of children who are under age 17 at the end of the tax year may qualify for a credit up to $1,000 per qualifying child. The credit is a dollar-for-dollar reduction of tax liability, and may be listed on Line 51 of Form 1040. For every $1,000 of adjusted gross income above the threshold limit ($110,000 for married joint filers; $75,000 for single filers), the amount of the credit decreases by $50. Child and dependent care credit : If a taxpayer must pay for childcare for a child under age 13 in order to pursue or maintain gainful employment, he or she may claim a credit up to $3,000 of his or her eligible expenses for dependent care. If one parent stays home full-time, however, no child care costs are eligible for the credit. Credit for adoption expenses: a credit up to $10,000, phased out at higher incomes. Taxpayers who have incurred qualified adoption expenses in 2011 may claim either a $13,360 credit against tax owed or a $13,360 income exclusion if the taxpayer has received payments or reimbursements from his or her employer for adoption expenses. For 2012, the amount of the credit will decrease to $12,650, and in 2013 to $5,000. [14] Family tax credit is a payment for each dependent child aged 18 or young [15] Education, energy and other subsidies [ edit ] Some systems indirectly subsidize education and similar expenses through tax credits. The U.S. system has the following nonrefundable credits: Two mutually exclusive credits for qualified tuition and related expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit is 100% of the first $2,000 and 25% of the next $4000 of qualified tuition expenses per year for up to two years. The Lifetime Learning Credit [16] is 20% of the first $10,000 of cumulative expenses. These credits are phased out at incomes above $50,000 ($100,000 for joint returns) in 2009. Expenses for which a credit is claimed are not eligible for tax deduction . First time homebuyers credit up to $7,500 (closing date before Sept. 30, 2010). Credits for purchase of certain nonbusiness energy property and residential energy efficiency. Several credits apply with differing rules. [17] Business tax credits [ edit ] Many systems offer various incentives for businesses to make investments in property or operate in particular areas. Credits may be offered against income or property taxes, and are generally nonrefundable to the extent they exceed taxes otherwise due. The credits may be offered to individuals as well as entities. The nature of the credits available varies highly by jurisdiction. United States [ edit ] U.S. income tax has numerous nonrefundable business credits. In most cases, any amount of these credits in excess of current year tax may be carried forward to offset future taxes, with limitations. The credits include the following (for a full list see section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code): Alternative motor vehicle credit: several credits are available for purchase of varying types of non-gasoline powered vehicles. [18] Alternative fuel credits: a credit based on the amount of production of certain non-petroleum fuels. [19] Disaster relief credits [20] Credits for employing individuals in certain areas or those formerly on welfare or in targeted groups Credit for increasing research expenses A variety of industry specific credits Many sub-Federal jurisdictions (states, counties, cities, etc.) within the U.S. offer income or property tax credits for particular activities or expenditures. Examples include credits similar to the Federal research and employment credits, property tax credits, (often called abatements), granted by cities for building facilities within the city, etc. These items often are negotiated between a business and a governmental body, and specific to a particular business and property. Federal nonrefundable investment tax credits [ edit ] Tax credits, while they come in many forms, are authorized incentives under the Internal Revenue Code (and some state tax codes) to implement public policy. Congress, in an effort to encourage the private sector to provide a public benefit, allows a participating taxpayer a dollar for dollar reduction of their tax liability for investments in projects that probably would not occur but for the credits. Federal Historic Rehabilitation Tax Credit [ edit ] The legislative incentive program to encourage the preservation of “historical buildings”. Congress instituted a two-tier Tax Credit incentive under the 1986 Tax Reform Act. A 20% credit is available for the rehabilitation of historical buildings and a 10% credit is available for non-historic buildings, which were first placed in service before 1936. Benefits are derived from tax credits in the year the property is placed in service, cash flow over 6 years and repurchase options in year six. [21] Renewable Energy/Investment Tax Credit (ITC) [ edit ] The investment tax credit is allowed section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code. This investment tax credit varies depending on the type of renewable energy project; solar, fuel cells ($1500/0.5 kW) and small wind (< 100 kW) are eligible for credit of 30% of the cost of development, with no maximum credit limit; there is a 10% credit for geothermal, microturbines (< 2 MW) and combined heat and power plants (< 50 MW). The ITC is generated at the time the qualifying facility is placed in service. Benefits are derived from the ITC, accelerated depreciation, and cash flow over a 6-8 year period. [22] Though set to expire at the end of 2015, the ITC for residential solar installations was renewed in December 2015. The credit will continue at 30% through 2018, and will slowly decline to 10% in 2022. The ITC for other technologies (including geothermal) was extended by one year. [23] Installations will be considered eligible for the ITC based on the date that construction starts. [24] Renewable Energy/Production Tax Credit (PTC) [ edit ] See also: United States Wind Energy Policy § History of the Production Tax Credit Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code allows an income tax credit of 2.3 cents/kilowatt-hour (as adjusted for inflation for 2013 [25] ) for the production of electricity from utility-scale wind turbines, geothermal, solar, hydropower, biomass and marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy plants. This incentive, the renewable energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), [26] was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (at the value of 1.5 cents/kilowatt-hour, which has since been adjusted annually for inflation). [27] In late 2015 a large majority in Congress voted [28] to extend the PTC for wind and solar power for 5 years and $25 billion. Analysts expect $35 billon of investment for each type. [29] Low Income (Affordable) Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) [ edit ] Under this program , created in the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the U.S Treasury Department allocates tax credits to each state based on that states population. These credits are then awarded to developers who, together with an equity partner, develop and maintain apartments as affordable units. Benefits are derived primarily from the tax credits over a 10-year period. Qualified School Construction Bond (QSCB) [ edit ] QSCBs are U.S. debt instruments used to help schools borrow at nominal rates for the rehabilitation, repair and equipping of their facilities, as well as the purchase of land upon which a public school will be built. A QSCB holder receives a Federal tax credit in lieu of an interest payment. The tax credits may be stripped from QSCB bonds and sold separately. QSCBs were created by Section 1521 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Internal Revenue Code Section 54F also addresses QSCBs. Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) [ edit ] The Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) is a federal tax credit providing incentives to employers for hiring groups facing high rates of unemployment, such as veterans, youths and others. WOTC helps these targeted groups obtain employment so they are able to gain the skills and experience necessary to obtain better future job opportunities. The WOTC is based on the number of hours an employee works and benefits the employer directly. In December 2014, the credit was extended retroactively to the beginning of 2014 by the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014 (TIPA), P.L. 113-295. [30] That act authorized the credit only through December 31, 2014. [31] American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) [ edit ] The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) [32] was part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which was signed into law in February 2009. The AOTC replaced the Hope Scholarship credit for Tax Years 2009 and 2010, increased the benefits for nearly all Hope credit recipients and many other students by providing a maximum benefit up to $2,500 per student, 100 percent of their first $2,000 in tuition and 25 percent of the next $2,000, expanding the income range over which taxpayers can claim a credit, and making the credit partially refundable. Critics have complained that complexity and restrictions on eligibility make the actual benefits per post-secondary student much lower than the theoretical maximum, and that even with tax credits, higher education remains tax-disadvantaged compared to other investments. [33] State tax credits [ edit ] Approximately 43 states provide a variety of special incentive programs that utilize state tax credits. These include Brownfield credits, Film Production credits, Renewable energy credits, Historic Preservation credits and others. The amount of credit, the term of credit and the cost of the credit differs from state to state. These credits can be either in the form of a certificate, which can be purchased as an asset, or in a more traditional pass through entity. The tax credits can generally be used against insurance company premium tax, bank tax and income tax. Oregon Residential Energy Tax Credit (RETC) [ edit ] The state of Oregon's RETC is a tax credit for solar systems. In 2016, Oregon Governor Kate Brown released a new budget proposal that does not extend the RETC program. In 2015, RETC gave $12.2 million in tax credits; in 2014, that amount was approximately $4.2 million. [34] Under the budget proposal, the credit will sunset at the end of 2017. Extension of the tax credit is a top priority for Oregon's solar industry. [35] Value added tax [ edit ] Resellers or producers of goods or providers of services (collectively, providers) must collect value added tax (VAT) in some jurisdictions upon billing or being paid by customers. Where these providers use goods or services provided by others, they may have paid VAT to other providers. Most VAT systems allow the amount of such VAT paid or considered paid to be used to offset VAT payments due, generally referred to as an input credit. Some systems allow the excess of input credits over VAT obligations to be refunded after a period of time. Foreign tax credit [ edit ] Income tax systems that impose tax on residents on their worldwide income tend to grant a foreign tax credit for foreign income taxes paid on the same income. The credit often is limited based on the amount of foreign income. The credit may be granted under domestic law and/or tax treaty . The credit is generally granted to individuals and entities, and is generally nonrefundable. See Foreign tax credit for more comprehensive information on this complex subject. Credits for alternative tax bases [ edit ] Several tax systems impose a regular income tax and, where higher, an alternative tax. The U.S. imposes an alternative minimum tax based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Mexico imposes an IETU based on an alternative measure of taxable income. Italy imposes an alternative tax based on assets. In each case, where the alternative tax is higher than the regular tax, a credit is allowed against future regular tax for the excess. The credit is usually limited in a manner that prevents circularity in the calculation. See also [ edit ] Tax choice References [ edit ] ^ Piper, Mike (Sep 12, 2014).

Technology can assist enterprises in tackling the Goods and Services Tax Who is afraid of GST? Top four trends in enterprise technology in 2017 3,705 3,705 Image for representational purpose only ( Photo: Babu Babu / Reuters) The GST will be implemented this year. The new law is expected to help the overall growth of economy and a softening in prices and may even translate into a 2 percent GDP growth, according to experts. Besides making taxation simpler, the GST will impact all industries, of which the most remarkable effect is expected to be on transport and highways. India’s logistics industry is worth over $130 billion and is critical to the country’s plans to mature into an economic superpower. However, it wouldn’t be possible unless a more efficient logistics industry is in place. The GST is expected to remove bottlenecks in the full-fledged development of logistics infrastructure and lead to smoother transport system. The GST would replace the obsolete and inefficient transport system of yore that was built around the state taxation system. Analyzing the problems of the logistics industry Logistics should ideally make commercial activities efficient, but it is caught in the web of complex rules and regulations. There is a lot of paper work involved that impedes the flow of goods. Transporters are required to have in their possession hard copies of invoice as well as various forms. All this leads to enormous delays. The GST, however, will eliminate queues at state border checkpoints. Documentation will be simplified. All this should cut down the high average waiting time and stoppages on highways. With a single GST in place, monitoring and collection of sales tax at interstate barriers would be obviated. A survey estimates that if the waiting time of trucks at various interstate checkpoints is reduced by half, it will lead to an additional 8 percent trucks on highways. The GST would translate into increased uptime for trucks, decrease in idle hours, better turnaround times and optimized warehousing structure. The current scenario is however far from ideal. Currently, central and State governments levy different taxes separately. A Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report says that a typical truck spends 16 percent time at check-posts. On an average, a truck in India runs an annual distance of 85,000 km compared to 150,000 to 200,000 km in Western countries. The industry is fragmented due to the state-level tax structures, which forces enterprises to put up warehouses in every state. This makes the supply chain longer than necessary and to a certain extent inefficient. Additionally, due to the complex tax structure, the transport industry spends 50-60 percent of resources on tax compliance and deposit of interstate sales tax. “The GST eliminates double taxation and enables a shared national market. This leads to better collections. Most importantly, the GST prevents or at least de-incentivizes tax evasion,” says Somesh Misra, VP, Product, Deskera. GST would bring startups and SMEs at par with big corporate houses Currently, big corporate houses “stock transfer” goods to other states and avoid paying tax on interstate movement. However, that is not the case with small players. Due to lack of infrastructure, SMEs and startups can’t do that and have to procure goods through interstate sales (in the place of stock transfers) and have to pay Central sales tax on them. In this regard, the GST brings startups and SMEs at par with the big corporate houses as stock transfers would be taxed as well. Logistics includes transportation, warehousing, distribution and optimization. The GST will lead to concentrated logistic supply chains which are efficient, eventually leading to centralization to make the process of claiming credits easier. Tax compliance hitches would also get resolved. Regional warehouse hubs would emerge since a manufacturer won’t need warehouses in every state. This would lead to centralization of resources and consolidation of the industry. I expect key business hubs to emerge. Manufacturers can, therefore, have a hub, for instance, in Delhi which can cater to the entire north region, doing away with the need to have a separate warehouse for every state separately. The logistics chain, consequently, becomes leaner and smarter. All said and done, the GST is not effective now and only time will tell the exact effectiveness of the new law after its implementation. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. - By Muqbil Ahmar, Technology Evangelist Goods and Services Tax GST Highways Logistics Tax Truck Warehouses Comments 0 Insta-Subscribe to Forbes India Magazine For hassle free instant subscription, just give your number and email id and our customer care agent will get in touch with you OR click here to Subscribe Online Popular Now Read Audio Blogs Commented 58 Indian companies in 2017 Forbes 'Global 2000' list New Tata Sons boss starts putting his A-team together: What it means Even a small grocery store should be able to experience IBM: Karan Bajwa India's bold vision in scaling up solar Three Indian companies take giant steps with clean technology India-born Rajeev Misra inducted into SoftBank board RBI tightening its noose around Indian banks' non-performing assets When Michael Jackson was Trump's neighbour.

All about the technology that GST will bank on from July By ECONOMICTIMES.COM | May 30, 2017, 04.55 PM IST Post a Comment Finance minister Arun Jaitley's GST task won't be easy, considering the fact that GSTN will be processing as many as 3.5 billion invoices each month from July. Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You The success of India's biggest tax reform hinges on a trouble-free show from the technology that will run it. When GST finally comes to play in July, there will be much pressure on the GSTN or the goods and services tax network, the IT backbone of the landmark tax reform, that promises to make India a uniform tax country. The task won't be easy, considering the fact that GSTN, according to a Bloomberg report, will be processing as many as 3.5 billion invoices each month from July, with 8 million direct taxpayers requiring to file up to 37 tax returns in a year. Built over the last two years, the GSTN is designed to be the common interface for Centre and state governments, taxpayers, tax authorities and banks. ""India’s GST is the most complex of all the countries which have implemented GST,"" chairman of the GSTN Navin Kumar told Bloomberg, noting that work on the system began two years ago when the only available guidance available was draft laws. ""Despite not having all the input, we have been working on it and we will be ready by July."" But not many share Kumar's confidence. Skeptics fear of a demonetisation-like situation triggered by a poorly prepared IT system. ""After July 1, half of the people will fail to comply with the new system, especially small units and services industry as they won’t be ready,"" says Sachin Menon, partner and head of indirect taxes at KPMG India. M Veerappa Moily of the Congress, which initially proposed the tax in 2006 when it held power, has cautioned the government that rushing the GST roll out could create a “technological nightmare” for businesses. Invoices are not the only challenge With the impending GST rollout, there are several cyber threats to GSTN. Concerns have heightened after the recent ransomware attack and Legion hacking of social media data a few months ago. The attack and subsequent plans to build a cyber security unit was confirmed by two sources. “There were attempts from countries such as Pakistan and China to swarm the system with a DDOS attack and bring it down. GSTN was able to ensure the system was not disrupted,” one source aware of the development told ET. Experts feel GSTN can expect hacking attempts, given the importance of commercial data it will handle. “Regarding the threat landscape, it is as bad as it’s ever been, if not worse. Cyber crime is big business and is growing at an exponential rate,” said Rajesh Maurya, regional vice-president, India & SAARC, at Fortinet , a global cyber security solutions company. What does one need to be GST compliant from July? According to EasemyGST co-founder Ashish Mittal, here's what businesses need before July: a. Personal Computer b. Internet Connection c. Ability to record invoice (could be a spreadsheet) d. Subscription to ASP/GSP or know-how to directly upload invoices on Government portal Who is an ASP and GSP? GSTN will store all data pertaining to GST (including invoices and returns) and creat multiple gates to this infrastructure through GSP (GST Suvidha Provider) who will carry taxpayer data to GSTN servers. Application Service Providers (ASP) are working with GSP to provide value addition in this entire compliance platform starting from ability to integrate with ERP's and help in match-making and filing returns. Where and when do I start? 1. Start analyzing the impact on GST on your business by ensuring that your suppliers are getting ready to and they will have mechanism to create and upload invoices in GST formats. 2. Enable basic technology platform for Invoicing in GST supported formats 3. Identify the ASP/GSP to work. 4.

Is India Inc prepared for GST? Share Comment To get such articles in your inbox Text size: A A A Last updated on: May 29, 2017 16:04 IST 'Awareness levels are much higher after demonetisation. Disruption will also be far lower now, as the tax rates in GST are going to be similar to the existing ones.' 'Investors shouldn't have high expectations on corporate earnings.' In a conversation with Vishal Chhabria and Hamsini Karthik , Gautam Chhaochharia , bottom , left , executive director & head, India Research, UBS, explains why implementing goods and services tax (GST) may not be as disruptive as many perceive it to be. But, he warns investors shouldn't have high expectations on corporate earnings. Excerpts: How disruptive will GST be? Given the complexity, it has to be disruptive in the short term. The system can never be 100 per cent prepared for a change like this. The question is whether the disruption can last longer and the level of preparedness. From a short-term perspective, the impact is going to be far less than it would have been last year. Continuous delays in rolling it out means the bigger part of the ecosystem is better prepared. Now, the challenge is how the smaller businesses, informal business, supply chain, etc, behave. Awareness levels are much higher after demonetisation. Disruption will also be far lower now, as the tax rates in GST are going to be similar to the existing ones. But, whether the disruption prolongs beyond three to six months needs to be seen. How the informal sector will respond - whether by paying taxes and still be viable or shut down because they are unviable, we don’t know yet. Some consumption-based mid-cap stocks have rallied on expectations that organised players will gain market share due to GST. We did an exercise to find the impact of formalisation. The valuations might have already captured the impact. However, stocks can still do well so long as these keep delivering numbers and assuming they don’t de-rate from the current rich valuations. Companies in general will be able to gain market share because broadly the consumption space has informal players, too. The hope is high among big companies. Gradual formalisation is good. Overnight formalisation might be tricky. Is the market factoring in for likely disruption due to GST? The Street expectation for FY18 earnings doesn’t factor in the impact of GST, as it may be a one quarter event. GST is a short-term disruption. People won’t stop consuming things because of GST. This was the argument we used for demonetisation impact, saying pessimism was overdone. From earnings reporting perspective, there could be over-reporting or under-reporting for two quarters but it is not a permanent destruction of demand. Earnings have been disappointing in recent years. The FY18 growth expectation is 16-20 per cent. Is is optimistic? We will see earnings cut in FY18 . In the past one month, we have seen earnings cut for FY18 by two per cent. We are looking at 12 per cent earnings growth for Nifty companies, building in a reduction in credit cost for banks. But, if the same level of provisioning continues, then even this will be at risk. We will see similar sectors like FY17 - pockets of financials, consumer and automobiles do ok. FY17 was helped by metals and mining, which could moderate in FY18. But, our view hasn’t changed, which is that local macros are solid and stable. Growth recovery will still be delayed. What we have seen now in Q4 is a bit of post-note ban recovery. We see normalising activity now, but an accelerated earnings growth in FY18 seems unlikely. Affordable housing is talked about as the next high-growth space. You agree? Affordable housing for the poor has been there even historically. The government is trying to give it a push. It has the big challenge of funding and execution. Execution record there is far behind what the government is planning. The government is planning to build 20x urban homes on an annualised basis and 5x rural houses versus what they have delivered over the past three years. Private sector viability in small-ticket houses is debatable. Middle income (up to Rs 18 lakh household income) where you get interest subsidy may do better as the ticket size there is around Rs 50 lakh and there is already enough inventory. This scheme may induce the households to leverage and can be significant for macro growth. When government is spending one rupee, it is forcing the household to spend 10 times more. But, the challenge here is the budgetary allocation - Rs 1,000 crore (Rs 10 billion) is peanuts as 60 per cent of those who can avail mortgages will anyway avail it. So, unless the spending is more than Rs 27,000 crore (Rs 270 billion), the tool may not be powerful. Your overall view on the market now? Markets are very stretched and that holds true for most sectors. Our approach is where we see visibility for sharp earnings growth. In current environment, if earnings growth is there, the valuations will at least not de-rate. So, within that, select financials (retail and non-banks), home improvement, and select automobiles and as tactical call, IT are something which we prefer.

16," www.gstindiaonline.com - A comprehensive resource on gst in india | Towards Practicial GST Classification Scheme for Services under GST List of Services under reverse charge Schedule of GST rates for services and list services exempted GST Rate Schedule for Goods List of Goods liable for cess Ofcourse, registration is Free! Click to View Archives of Home Page Greetings! GST ? Should implementation scheduled on July 1, 2017, be postponed? The question uppermost in the minds of all stakeholders is whether GST would be implemented on July 1, 2017 or postponed to maybe August 1 or September 1, 2017. While we would know for certain on June 3, 2017 when the GST Council meets, preparedness of Trade and Industry is a matter of concern which we hope the GST Council would also review. The legislative agenda for the GST Council on June 3, 2017 is to decide on rate of tax for certain Goods and Services and approve the GST Transition and Return Rules, respective formats and also review the preparedness of the IT infrastructure of GSTN. The concerns are:- ? Readiness of GSP / ASP One of the concerns expressed is that the time required for GSP / ASP to prepare the software for the revised format of returns which is expected to be approved on June 3, 2017. GSTN would make available the API thereafter and it would take 3-4 weeks to get ready the software for filing of returns. Though the first Returns are required to be filed only in August, 2017, small dealers most of whom may not use the services of ASP and would be using excel based utility need time to understand and configure reporting formats. It is expected that Excel Utility would be made available by GSTN to upload data to populate the returns. ? Transition Credit Entitlement Transition Rules and Formats are expected to be finalized on June 3,2017. With less than 4 week available after approval of Transition Rules and Formats, trade and industry would have very little time to configure their software to prepare details for filing the returns to claim transition tax credit. The short time to prepare details to claim transition credit would disable claiming of transition credit in the first return period itself creating cash flow issues. ? E Way Bill E Way Bill is another concern. The E Way Bill Rules are not yet approved and it is not sure if this would be taken up in the GST Council Meeting on June 3,2017. Besides the time constraint on Trade and Industry to put in place necessary software to generate E way Bills, the Tax Administration also needs to put in place the software for uploading of E way Bills and monitoring. As on date there is no information on the preparedness of the Tax Administration. It is therefore likely that implementation of E Way Bill Rules may have to be delayed. ? SGST Acts / Notifications Many States are yet to pass the SGST Act. States that have passed the SGST law have not yet made available the SGST Act in the public domain. (we checked the State VAT websites). Though details of Goods and Services exempt from GST and list of services liable to service tax is announced, Notifications to give effect to this and several other notifications, issuing of which is specified in the GST Acts, have to be issued by the Central Government as well as the State Governments. All these notifications after they are issued are to be understood. This would be a great effort for SMEs and small traders, which requires time. ? Mapping HSN with description of Goods as in present VAT Schedules Traders who hitherto were liable to pay VAT only are familiar only with the simple and commercial description of the Goods listed in the Schedules to the VAT Acts of the respective States. Though HSN is noted against description of Goods in the Schedule to the VAT Act of most of the States, the traders would mostly go by the description of the Goods only. Since under GST, the schedule of goods is listed Chapter wise with description of Goods as in the HSN, traders would find it very difficult to understand. It is therefore important that as in the present schedule to the VAT Acts, Goods liable to tax at different rates under GST is made available with the simple and commercial description ( as in present VAT Schedule of Goods) appropriately mapped to HSN. This is essential for easy adoption of GST by traders. This can be made available with the disclaimer that it is only for guidance and description as in the GST Schedule of tax rates of Goods will prevail. It is surprising that the concerns on roll out of GST from July 1,2017 have not been publicly aired by the Stakeholders except perhaps Sri Amit Mitra, Finance Minister, West Bengal and Chairman of the empowered committee of State Finance Ministers. Here is what he is reported to have stated in his letter to Sri Jaitley, Union Finance Minister: ""My particular concern relates to the small and medium enterprises of India who are nowhere close to being ready to comply with this major fiscal reform. It is noteworthy that these MSMEs produce around 40 per cent of India's GDP and provide employment to nearly 100 million people."" ""By introducing GST before the due preparedness of all links in the production chain, a domino effect could be let loose on the economy, undermining all sectors of the economy and particularly adversely affecting the states."" ""I am concerned that while larger industries may be better prepared, their vendors at tier II and III levels are still struggling to create the wherewithal to cope with the GST mechanism. You would agree that if tier II and III vendors are not ready to operationalise GST, it would simply mean that larger industries, even if ready on their own, will not be able to seek input tax credit from the production chain. A fractured production chain would create huge problems,"" In most countries where GST was implemented, the time between the publication of Draft Laws and date of implementation was one to two years. Undoubtedly lot of ground work has been done meticulously by the GST Council, Finance Ministry and Officials and the team deserves all praise for what is accomplished. Though details of the GST Act and Rules have been in the public domain for quite some time now, the larger entities with expert professional assistance would be better prepared than the SMEs and smaller entities. While the law is broadly in line with the present tax system, it is the compliance that the smaller entities are yet to understand. There is a need for intensive training programmes on the compliances particularly filing of returns, for GST transition to be smooth. We are sure the GST Council would take a considered decision on the date of implementation of GST. GST ? Migration of Registration For those of you who missed the earlier timeline to migrate your registration under the present law to GST, the window to migrate would be open from June 1 to 15,2017.

The intermediary later files a tax return and forwards the tax proceeds to government with the return. In this sense, the term indirect tax is contrasted with a direct tax , which is collected directly by government from the persons (legal or natural) on whom it is imposed. Some commentators have argued that ""a direct tax is one that cannot be changed by the taxpayer to someone else, whereas an indirect tax can be."" [1] An indirect tax may increase the price of a good to raise the price of the products for the consumers. [2] Examples would be fuel, liquor, and cigarette taxes. An excise duty on motor cars is paid in the first instance by the manufacturer of the cars; ultimately, the manufacturer transfers the burden of this duty to the buyer of the car in the form of a higher price. Thus, an indirect tax is one that can be shifted or passed on. The degree to which the burden of a tax is shifted determines whether a tax is primarily direct or primarily indirect. This is a function of the relative elasticity of the supply and demand of the goods or services being taxed. Under this definition, even income taxes may be indirect. The term indirect tax has a different meaning in the context of American Constitutional law : see direct tax and excise tax in the United States . In the United States, the federal income tax has been, since its inception on July 1, 1862, [3] an indirect tax [4] (more specifically an excise [5] [6] ) even though during the 1940s, its application grew from a historical average [7] of about 8% of the population paying it to around 90% of the population paying it as a measure to support the war effort. Contents 1 Features 2 Excise duty 3 See also 4 Notes Features [ edit ] Indirect taxation is policy commonly used to generate tax revenue . Indirect tax is so called as it is paid indirectly by the final consumer of goods and services while paying for purchase of goods or for enjoying services. It is broadly based since it is applied to everyone in the society whether rich or poor. Since the cost of the tax does not vary according to income, indirect taxation includes Ad Valorem tax and Specific tax, of which Ad Valorem(VAT, GST) is proportional and Specific tax is fixed. However, indirect taxation can be viewed as having the effect of a regressive tax as it imposes a greater burden (relative to resources) on the poor than on the rich, as both rich and poor pay the same tax amount for consumption of a certain quantity of a specific good. The taxpayer who pays the tax does not bear the burden of tax; the burden is shifted to the ultimate consumers. In the case of a direct tax, the taxpayer has to bear the burden of tax personally; in case of indirect tax the taxpayer and the taxbearer are not the same person. Excise duty [ edit ] Excise duty is a governmental tax meant for producers and manufacturers on certain goods. [8] Manufacturers are considered to be: Entities who manufacture goods themselves. Entities who outsource manufacturing, but manufacturing takes place from their name To cover these costs, manufacturer adds them to COGS ( cost of goods sold ), where the buyer ends up paying for these costs. Thus, it is considered to be an indirect tax.

Arkamoy Dutta Majumdar Amit Mitra said he will continue to fight in the GST Council for reduction in rates and exemption of certain items. Photo: Indranil Bhowmik/Mint Kolkata: West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on Tuesday said the country was not ready yet to roll out the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 1 July. Mitra, who is the chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers, said “rules and forms” of the GST are not ready yet and that its introduction should be delayed. Over 40% of so-called “suvidha” providers have not even started to test the network, he added. Mitra said he will continue to fight in the GST Council for reduction in rate and exemption of certain items such as footwear priced at less than Rs500, cashew nuts, films and single-screen theatres because the rates proposed will seriously impact businesses across India, not just in West Bengal. West Bengal, however, has not planned to move the GST bill in the state assembly yet. Partha Chatterjee, the minister for parliamentary affairs, said the state would decide on moving the bill after the issues raised by Mitra over proposed taxes are dealt with in the GST Council.

CAIT seeks reclassification Moneylife Digital Team 29 May 2017 To bookmark you need to sign in 0 There is growing discontent, especially among the trading community, over the classifications under the goods and service tax (GST). Items, which were in the lower category under value added tax (VAT) are now being categorised in higher tax slabs under GST, says a traders' body. In a release, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said, ""...classification of different items under various tax slabs of GST has created an environment of anxiety and concern among the trading community across the country, leading various verticals of retail trade to demand lower tax on the items being dealt by them since they have been categorised under higher tax slab in comparison to tax slab of current VAT tax regime."" About 1,211 goods and 36 services have been so far classified under GST, of which nearly 50% goods have been placed under 8% rate, 14% under 5% rate, 17% under 12% rate and 19% under 28% rate. The GST Council is yet to decide the tax bracket for items like textiles, gems and jewellery, and footwear. In view of the growing discontent over proposed GST rates, CAIT says it has urged the government to revisit the rate schedule. It says, ""The wider impact of the classification of items under different tax slabs needs to be gauged very cautiously, since under GST not only the taxes paid on goods but even the taxes paid on the services will be eligible for input tax credit, whereas on the other hand taxes paid on inter-state purchases of goods or availing services will also be eligible for input tax credit. Hitherto, both these advantages were not available under VAT tax regime. Therefore, impact on the prices of commodities will have to be drawn after calculating advantages of input tax credit."" ""However,"" the traders' body says, ""items like auto spare parts, which are under 5% VAT slab, have been placed under 28%, though milk is exempted but ghee and butter have been placed under 12% GST slab. Items related to construction and infrastructure like cement, builders hardware, iron & steel have been placed under 28% expecting to make housing and infrastructure costly under GST regime. General consumables like turmeric, jeera, red chilly, and dhania have been placed under 5% instead of exempted goods unlike other food products. Hand bags, wallet and similar items have been under the slab of 28% similar to marble, stone, iron & steel, and plywood used for construction of buildings. Pickles, sauces, instant mixer and some of the other items pertaining to food processing have been placed under 18% tax slab though these are consumed by large number of common people across the country. Though, utensils are in 12% tax rate but other incidental items like cutlery have been placed in 18% tax slab. Items used by students like crayon, pastels have been under 12% tax rate. Though contraceptives have been under exempted category, women hygiene product sanitary napkins has been placed under 12% tax rate."" CAIT has suggested that, to make transportation more economical, the tax slab of tyres and tubes, pegged at 28%, may also be reduced to a lower slab. ""While carrying out fitment of goods under different tax slabs of GST, the motive is to expand the tax base, no cascading impact on prices and easy compliance of the taxation system. In furtherance of the same, the CAIT has suggested the Government to constitute a Joint Committee of senior Officials and representatives of trade and industry to iron out the difference of opinion on tax rates,"" says BC Bhartia, National President, and Praveen Khandelwal, Secretary General of CAIT. User Alert me when a new comment is posted Life The ghost who writes: Thriving business of anonymous authorship Saket Suman (IANS) 29 May 2017 To bookmark you need to sign in 2 What if you were told that many of the books that you have read of late have actually not been written by the authors who find mention on their covers? Difficult to believe -- but true. An anonymous world of ghostwriters lies hidden behind the glitz and glamour of the books business and literature festivals that most readers are unaware of. Sample this: ""Don't have time to write a book, but still want to be a published author? Go for our world-famous book ghostwriting option."" Absurd as it may sound, it is the tagline of Power Publishers, who, in their own words, are the world leaders when it comes to ghostwriting. And they are not alone, the internet is full of platforms that provide ghostwriters to those who cannot write but still want to be writers. A ghostwriter is an anonymous figure, who, by contract, agrees to write a given book for somebody else. The ghostwriter is paid a fairly good sum of money but has no claim over the copyright of the book or its royalties. When the book hits the stands, it carries someone else's name -- the perceived author for its readers. And, as a breed, ghostwriters are gaining prominence in the publishing industry. Forget self-publishing platforms or smaller publishers, many of the leading publishing houses too have, at some point or the other, sought the help of ghostwriters. Nirmal Kanti Bhattacharjee, former Director of the National Book Trust (NBT) and former Editor of ""Indian Literature"", Sahitya Akademi's bi-monthly journal, explains why. ""Successful people are gradually becoming more and more ambitious and want to talk about themselves -- and that they do through autobiographies and memoirs. But they do not have wherewithal to write books. So they employ ghostwriters. ""Most autobiographies and memoirs of popular figures in the past 20-25 years have been written, partially or wholly, by ghostwriters,"" Bhattacharjee, who is currently spearheading the editorial works of Niyogi Books, told IANS. Poulomi Chatterjee, Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Hachette India, which has many bestsellers to its credit, said that there are ""certain segments"" for which ghostwriters are used. ""You wouldn't find ghostwriters, I hope, for fiction because you are actually looking for the author's art and craft and voice and story. ""But for non-fiction, there might be experts in various subjects that you want information from. They could be entrepreneurs, business professors or academic historians and you would want them to collaborate with a ghostwriter when they have a lack of time or... don't necessarily have the skill to (write),"" said Chatterjee, who had a long stint at Penguin India before Hachette. For Udayan Mitra, Publisher-Literary of HarperCollins India, ghostwriting has become much more prevalent and organised than it was before and this, he felt, benefits the publishing industry in the long run. ""It has become a lot more professional... it used to be that the author or an editor knew a particular person who was capable of the task. But now there are many more people who are doing it, who have the experience of doing it, and they know how to turn an idea into a book,"" Mitra told IANS. Sharing an interesting anecdote about working with a ghostwriter (before he joined HarperCollins), Mitra said that some five years ago, a big industry leader wished to do a memoir on himself and his corporation -- and so they had this hunt for a ghostwriter, which ended with a foreign journalist. ""The person landed up in India for ghostwriting the proposed book, but the first day in Delhi he was struck by Delhi Belly and every time he recovered, it would strike again. The corporate leader was getting worried because he had flown him to India and was paying a lot of money for the project. He had also put aside a lot of time from his hectic schedule. Eventually, the book happened -- but it was a funny as well as tragic experience,"" recalled Mitra. Ghostwriters as well as several online platforms suggest that they are paid decently. Ghostwriters are available at about Rs700 per page (containing 250 words) for fiction books on several online platforms. Of course, the amount of money that many well-to-do are willing to pay ghostwriters for writing a book on their lives or their business is astonishing -- sometimes running into several lakhs of rupees. Conversation with a ghostwriter - on condition of anonymity I was staring at the hundreds of people walking up and down the platforms as metro trains whizzed past the busy Rajiv Chowk station in the Capital when the humble voice of a middle-aged man brought my anticipation to an end. ""Am I the ghostwriter you are waiting for?"" he asked. It was as dramatic as it could get and my subject proposed that we have our conversation after boarding a train towards Noida. Working on a feature on ghostwriting in the Indian publishing business, I had been chasing him for about two weeks. He had finally consented to share his experience of ghostwriting on -- what else? -- the condition of anonymity. And yet, it seemed weird to have this conversation in a moving train instead of the CCD as agreed earlier. During peak hour, when one struggles to even put two legs together, it seemed a mammoth task to have a serious discussion. ""I am nowhere in the picture. That is the very first principle of ghostwriting,"" the somewhere in his forties man said as we squeezed through people to reach the far end of the compartment. ""The editors give you commands like the gangsters provide directions to contract killers. I have to follow them and be happy with the money that I receive,"" he added. I was startled by his analogy. He seemed to be on a mission to frighten me with references of contract killers and gangsters. But it is not all that bad, is it? Ghostwriting must have a lot of advantages too, I suggested after sharing snippets of my conversations on ghostwriting with editors of several leading publishing houses. ""Oh! It is not bad at all. It is wonderful actually. I have been doing this for about a decade now and I have no regrets. Once you are able to build a body of work for yourself, get yourself noticed by the publishers and have a rapport with the editors, the projects keep coming and you make quite a lot of money,"" explained the man, who claimed to have ghostwritten six books so far. And then there is always the big project that any ghostwriter is looking for. For him, it was a memoir of ""a filthy rich businessman"". ""It happened in 2013 when I literally begged an editor for this project. It worked out and I completed the book within eight months. He (the businessman) hardly had anything to share but we succeeded in building a narrative around his life. I earned more from the book than the total money recovered from its sales,"" he proudly claimed. Some may find this trend of publishing works by ghostwriters which neither sell nor merit a full-length book absurdly funny, but there are compelling reasons for India's booming publishing industry to support this phenomenon.

REPLY Economy & Nation How climate change is affecting Kinnaur's apples - and more Manu Moudgil (IANS) 29 May 2017 To bookmark you need to sign in 0 On April 16, Roshan Lal Negi woke up to find snow carpeting the courtyard of his home in Jangi village. Boys with smartphones quickly made videos to share on WhatsApp but more than a month later, the snow -- now filthy -- still sits on the lower parts of most peaks in Kinnaur district, Himachal Pradesh. Particles from a dust storm in the northern plains might have travelled to Kinnaur and mixed with the unseasonal snowfall, suggests Manmohan Singh, Director of the meteorological centre in Shimla, giving the dusty appearance. The jury is still out, but most agree that this rain shadow region is experiencing a drastic shift in its weather patterns. Rains are increasing, snowfall is declining, and temperatures are rising, which all have great impact on an area prone to landslides and fed by glacial melt. ""Nobody in cities is bothered about what's happening in Kinnaur. We are frequently facing such unusual weather events,"" Negi says. Droughts and excess rainfall are more frequent and more intensely felt due to the shift in farming, from coarse grains to commercial plantations of apple and green peas. Winter snowfall is also now more spread out. ""The heavy snow in December and January has declined and there's increased activity in February and March,"" says S.S. Randhawa, Senior Scientific Officer at the State Council for Science, Technology and Environment. The decadal average number of rainy days has increased by 43 per cent, from 77.4 days in 1980-90 to 111 days in 2000-2010, according to data from the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture. The number of dry spells during the Kharif season, on the other hand, shrank to 10-15 days, while most dry spells between 1980 and 1990 lasted more than 20. This increased rainfall leads to a greater erosion of fertile topsoil, and infestations of pests that thrive in the humidity. Kinnaur is famous for big and brightly-coloured apples, features caused by low night temperatures. Historically, the amount of crop lost to inclement weather has been low. In April and May, while apple trees in neighbouring Shimla district and adjoining hills are adorned with white nets to protect against hailstorms, orchards in Kinnaur enjoy clear weather. But increasing rainfall and declining snowfall is pushing people out of this routine. Cooler winter temperatures are important to induce dormancy, bud break and to ensure proper flowering in apples. But less snow, also reported in other parts of Himachal Pradesh, means that this crucial cool factor is not met, affecting apple quality and quantity. Apple growers in Kinnaur's low- and mid-altitude hills felt that rising temperatures had affected production, but farmers at more than 3,000 metres reported no decline due to temperature, according to a 2013 study. Most growers also reported a shift in the apple harvesting period due to increasing temperatures. The infestation of pests and diseases -- including apple scab and canker -- are some climate change indicators that increase the cost of production. Four years later, things are worse. This April, a month which typically sees the flowering and setting of fruits, has witnessed light showers almost daily. ""Rains reduce the chances of pollination as bees are more likely to stay in their hives,"" says Rakesh Kumar, an entomologist at the Y.S. Pramar University of Horticulture and Forestry. A traditionally dry region, the area does not have the means to deal with excess rainfall. Farms do not have proper drainage facilities as people never needed them. This causes waterlogging and diseases and insects which thrive on humidity. Bhagat Singh Negi, a farmer in Rarang village, is worried that not even 30 per cent of apple trees will bear fruit. ""New diseases crop up every year and even the chemicals we use are not as effective now. This year, many flowers dropped due to lack of pollination. It will be a difficult time for Kinnaur's economy,"" he says. Extreme weather events are also catching people unaware. In 2015, the Pooh sub division received far less snow than usual, which dried the irrigation sources used to water apples. ""We had to get water in tankers to save the trees. There was no harvest that year,"" says Gurmeet Negi, who owns an apple orchard. The villages of Tabo and Sunam in upper Kinnaur saw incessant rain in June 2014, usually a dry month, which led to an infestation of ascochyta blight of the green pea crop. As a result, the market value of pea dropped drastically. Farmers in Kinnaur take great pride in their low use of agrochemicals, but now most villages are seeing a rise in chemical use. ""Up until eight years ago, we used to spray chemicals only twice in a year,"" says R.C. Negi of Thangi village. ""Many would go without but now the frequency has gone up to seven sprays."" Other climate-indusced change has to do with residential structures. Concrete is fast replacing locally-sourced wood and stone as the preferred building material while traditional flat mud roofs are giving way to metal pent roofs. ""Increased rainfall in the historically-arid region erodes the flat mud roofs and wears away the mud-brick walls,"" says Tasha Kimmet, an art historian from University of Vienna, who studied the economic, climatic and cultural shifts in the region. She found that besides the improvement in economic conditions and increased accessibility to imported building materials, people are also adapting to changing weather patterns. ""Some residents, who are concerned about preserving their traditional building styles, are experimenting with tarps and waterproofing clays as part of the flat roof layering system, or building the roof at a subtle gradient,"" she says. People in Kinnaur are used to living on the edge, but they have not yet to come to terms with sudden shifts in weather. And if this year's dusty snow is any indication, the situation may not improve anytime soon.

Written by Aniruddha Ghosal | New Delhi | Updated: May 30, 2017 11:06 am CEA Arvind Subramanian at the Delhi Assembly on Monday. PTI Despite maintaining that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill could be a model for the 21st Century, Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian Monday rued that the system was far from being “flawless” since subjects such as real estate and alcohol remained outside its realm. Subramanian was speaking at an orientation programme at the Delhi Assembly, which, according to speaker Ram Niwas Goel, was to help MLAs understand the Bill and its scope. Subramanian said the GST Bill, in its present form, was the “best and model” for such a taxation policy in the 21st Century and an instance of “cooperative federalism”, but admitted it still had “too many subjects outside its realm to make it flawless”. He also said that in India, the problem of black money was linked to “land and real estate, gold, alcohol, politics and cash”. Jokingly evading any talk of politics, he said his “big hope for the GST” was “self-policing”. But by “keeping alcohol and land outside GST”, a “good anti-corruption device” that would aid in “governance” was lost, he said. “I really think that over time, we should try and bring land and real estate and alcohol within GST,” he said. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, meanwhile, said the “liquor lobby and real estate lobby” had been “successful in intervening” and that the two were kept outside the GST was because “politicians and influential people are involved in real estate… A number of political leaders have put their black money in these businesses”. While “conceptually” the GST was a “great idea” with particular benefits for Delhi — due to its service-oriented economy — it had “problems”, Sisodia said. He added that he was surprised that all state governments — ruled by BJP, Congress and others — had unanimously “rejected” the AAP government’s proposition to keep real estate within the GST. Subramanian also spoke about the macro-economic consequences of the Bill and said there would be several benefits. He said, “Centre and states have come together to share our sovereignty… There will be… conflict. But the nice thing is we can sit and discuss.” For all the latest Business News , download Indian Express App Tags: Arvind Subramanian GST M madhu May 30, 2017 at 8:03 am More corruption black money in real estate, Higher education medicine engineering, alchol.

It is a very distant, if at all, possibility that AAP will ever be a National Political force. AAP has been a remarkable phenomenon but like all such movements is destined to die as Modiji they have helped come to power is too potent for your own existence.

GST is scheduled to be rolled out on July 1. business Updated: May 30, 2017 20:57 IST Avijit Ghosal and Suchetana Ray Kolkata/New Delhi New Delhi: Union Minister for Finance and Corporate Affairs Arun Jaitley talks to West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra and Puducherry CM V Narayanasami at GST Council Meeting in New Delhi.(PTI) Heightening uncertainties about the Goods and Services Tax (GST), West Bengal today said that its assembly will not move the bills required to roll out the new indirect tax. GST is scheduled to be rolled out on July 1. While the Parliament had passed all the four GST-related bills during the budget session, states will have to ratify the State-GST legislation to rollout the new tax. Twenty-two states have so far passed the SGST Bill, other states have time till the first week of June to ratify it. The dissent was expressed by Amit Mitra, state finance minister at the state secretariat in Kolkata on Tuesday. He will raise the West Bengal’s objections in the next GST council meeting on June 3, Mitra said. Mitra also said that he will object to the Centre’s proposal to levy GST on items such as shoes, wig, and vernacular cinema. “I shall also highlight that there are major objections from different sectors of the state to rolling out GST from July 1. The services sector is against it”. Rolling out GST as it stands today will be a double-burden on the states that are yet to recover from the shocks of demonetisation, said the Bengal finance minister, who was also the chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers. This is not the first time that West Bengal has opposed GST. Along with Kerala, the state was foremost in its reservations against the new indirect tax. The objective of GST of creating a unified market will fail if it is not adopted by all states. But indirect tax reforms in India have seen staunch opposition even in the past, case in point the adoption of VAT. Certain states such as Uttar Pradesh adopted VAT much later than the rest of India. more from business Global fashion giants like Zara, M&S ‘fret’ over Modi govt’s cattle trade rules May 30, 2017 20:31 IST Mahindra’s Q4 profit-after-tax grows 20% at Rs 725 crore May 30, 2017 18:55 IST Red Alert – Rising cases of student suicides sound alarm bells across India Partnered Feature Recommended for you India World Business Education Autos Real estate Opinion Analysis Columns Editorials Authors Cities Delhi Gurgaon Noida Mumbai Bhopal Chandigarh Dehradun Indore Jaipur Kolkata Lucknow Patna Ranchi Pune Sports Cricket Football Tennis Others Entertainment Movie reviews Bollywood Hollywood Regional movies World cinema TV Music Tabloid Lifestyle Sex & relationship Fitness Fashion & trends Art & culture Travel Books Brunch Tech Tech Reviews Gadgets Photos Videos Epaper interactives Punjab Livemint Livehindustan Shine HTcampus Desimartini Studymate Englishmate HTsyndication Follow us on: Newsletter Register with Hindustan Times to get best news and articles Copyright © HT Media Limited All rights reserved.

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You BENGALURU: The Centre has decided to roll out GST from July 1, Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said in Bengaluru on Tuesday with an appeal to members of trade and commerce not to go by rumours about postponement. At an interaction with industry bodies, Adhia said people had been spreading rumours that GST rollout will be postponed by two months. He asked the industry bodies not to go by these reports, and said the government was fully prepared to implement the landmark tax reform. India has the potential to grow its GDP at 15%, and the GST rollout can make it happen, he said. Two US economists in their study of the impact of GST on India said the reforms will lead to an increase in GDP growth rate by 4%. In response to issues many members raised before, the Revenue Secretary said, “we have to find solution to problems rather than halting the whole process.” Going forward, he said, there is scope for rationalising tax rates. In reference to a specific issue, Adhia said there will be no GST on core banking services like deposits and loans, but other services will attract the tax.

38," Now enforcement will be done by GST, customs officers with access to details - The Financial Express SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Economy Now enforcement will be done by GST, customs officers with access to details Now enforcement will be done by GST, customs officers with access to details Increased checks will dent consumer goods imports, which often escaped attention of most state VAT authorities due to non-availability of import details. Now, enforcement will be done by GST and customs officers with much easier access to details. By: Somesh Arora | Published: May 30, 2017 6:00 AM GST laws as enacted, however, have certain special regulatory provisions to provide further teeth to the enforcement framework. (Image: PTI) Most fiscal statutes follow the usual rigmarole of incorporating elaborate provisions relating to civil and criminal liability through demand and recovery of interest, duty and penalty, prosecution, etc, after conducting scrutiny, audit, searches, investigations, etc. GST laws as enacted, however, have certain special regulatory provisions to provide further teeth to the enforcement framework. The provision of an e-way bill is unique in the Indian context and virtually ensures a physical control through an eye in the sky, on goods being transported through digital medium. It is more effective than the intrusive inspector raj under the physical control system. It also blocks the possibilities of human compromises, as contraventions can be detected anywhere when flagged by the system. The GSTN is to be informed of movement of any good valued more than Rs 50,000 by any registered dealer or a transporter to generate an e-way bill number, which will be mentioned in the e-way bill and produced during checks. The transport to be used shall be radio frequency identification device (RFID)-enabled to facilitate tracking. This requirement even extends to transporters who may carry more than one consignment or may shift part or whole to another vehicle. At the time of shifting goods, another e-way bill will be required to be generated. The system needs to be followed even for imported consignments before being moved out from the port of import. There is a number of stipulated days in which goods must reach the destination depending upon the distance involved for transportation. The manpower for enforcement will not only be provided by the states and the staff under CGST, but the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence will also be required to have a much greater sleuth presence—up from about 700 at present in the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI) to about 6,000 in the rechristened outfit. Other officers of the Union and the state, as empowered, shall be required to provide assistance. The onus to explain unexplained supplies has been shifted to the other side, as the department only needs to issue show-cause notice to the supplier and receiver of supplies, for any mismatch noticed by the GSTN. It is not without reason that the government is pitching for July 1, 2017, roll-out. There are bound to be certain palpable benefits of the same. First, the rates will go up for most imports, with the standard rate being more than the existing rate of central excise currently incorporated in customs duties as countervailing duty (CVD). Second, the movement of goods from the port on the e-way bill will be checked at the exit point and will create a visible record. Thereafter, any missing trail of stock will alert audit, which, through periodic checks, can verify available stock position or sales of the recipient to check leakages, in the medium term. This can dent consumer goods imports, which often escaped attention of most state VAT authorities due to non-availability of import details. Now, enforcement will be done by GST and customs officers with much easier access to details. It is also a well-known fact that imports of consumer goods are at their peak from China and other countries during the period from Diwali to December. Therefore, smugglers may find it difficult to connive and import goods like consumer items and crackers, as the risk of facing information transit checks will be much higher. There shall always exist a backward trail of such goods being sold even in retail in the market. The only possibilities that may remain for the operating smugglers, therefore, will be to either resort to undervaluation or use the usual ‘conceal and clear’ method in the container. Even the days for that may be numbered, as customs is directing most ICDs, including the private ones, to provide X-ray scanners for containers and store and save the scanned images for every container for customs to check anytime. The examination halls of customs may be fitted with video cameras. All this is bound to bring down smuggling to new lows. The bar-coded invoices will reduce the possibility of different value and description been given to customs at both ends. This cooperation can be sought not only under customs conventions, but also between member states under the Financial Action Task Force, where customs misdeclaration is a money-laundering offence. Another bonanza for the revenue that may accrue on the appointed day—i.e. the date on which provisions of CGST Act come into force that may even effectively make it a voluntary stock disclosure scheme during transition—will be disclosure in returns of stock without invoice found by supplier’s raw materials for evasion-prone industries like iron and steel, copper, plastics, etc. You might also want to see this: Disclosure may become the only option for such suppliers (other than a manufacturer or supplier of services) under the first proviso to Section 140(3), as they become entitled to have credit even without invoice, subject to the condition, inter alia, that such person shall pass the benefit of such credit to the recipient by way of reduced prices. This virtually allows an open window to scrap sellers or other small suppliers who were hitherto not covered under central excise, or even for SSI units to declare their stock positions liberally, to bring them into the GST stream. Therefore, the GST will be particularly beneficial to those taxpayers who were—even under earlier tax systems—discharging their tax duties properly. It may also allow those fence-sitters to survive with reasonable profits who will join the bandwagon and start paying their taxes properly and regularly. While for those, in whose case the old habits of evasion die hard, a much higher level of inventiveness will be required to beat the system, but higher risk of being caught will reduce it to a wager, and growth beyond a point in business may not be easy to come through.

For new businesses and startups, it becomes impossible to navigate through various direct and indirect taxes. Constant changes to taxes like Service Tax are making things even worst. But now, the things are set to change with new Goods and service tax – commonly known as GST. Lets understand what is GST, how it is different from other taxes, GST applicability, GST rates, its impact on your business and latest updates about GST bill. To make things easy to understand, I will start with an example.. Mr. Sharma is a businessman who wants to start a business. For this he needs various raw materials which have to be imported from China and will need to be brought to Gurgaon – where he has his factory – by road through various states. Once he gets down on the process of estimating his costs he is a little troubled. First, he needs to pay a customs duty for importing the materials on top of the shipping charges. This is fine but there are a lot of other taxes which he seems to be unable to comprehend. Also he finds out that when he has his final product ready he will have paid the Central and State Governments at least 10 different taxes not all of which are exclusive of each other. On diving deeper he finds many cases where a tax is also taxed by the government. Petrol prices are the perfect example. The price charged to dealers by the Oil Marketing Companies is Rs. 25.46 currently for a litre of petrol. Now Excise Duty is collected at Rs. 21.48 per litre by the Central Government and adding the dealer commission the price now is Rs. 49.22. This is not the end and Value Added Tax is now charged at 27% which takes the final price to Rs. 62.51 in Delhi. At first it may seem fair that both the Governments tax the product but it is not that innocuous. There is a tax on a tax here! The State Government charges 27% of the final amount in which Central Excise Duty has already been borne by the businessman. The Goods and Services Tax promises to alleviate this problem among many others. It is being hailed as the game changer for India’s economy and is being labelled as the biggest change in the Constitution since India’s independence. The Goods and Services tax or commonly referred to as the GST will replace the indirect taxes levied by the Central and State Governments and provide for a single and streamlined process. It presents India as a unified market to business owners and also aims at bringing a lot of black money back into the mainstream economy. The tax will be implemented at every step of value creation. Example Of GST Calculation Let us assume that the GST is set at 20%. Suppose that the manufacturing cost of a Product A is 100 and assuming a GST of 20% the total amount is Rs. 120. The next step of taxation would be when the Product is sold to consumers, let’s say at a price of 150. So the GST will charge another 20% on just the difference of Rs. 150 and Rs. 120 i.e. only 20% on Rs. 30 which is equal to Rs. 6. So the final price is Rs. 150 + Rs. 6. Unlike the case of petrol pricing there is no tax on a tax now. This eliminates the cascading effect of taxes which is very prevalent in our economy and has been simplified to an elemental level in the example. Since the GST will be applied at every step of value creation it will be very difficult for black money owners to participate anywhere in the value chain with the GST without accounting for all other transactions. The GST is estimated to provide an immediate boost of 0.9% – 1.4% of the GDP. 10 Frequently Asked Questions About GST Bill. 1) What are final GST rate slabs? The Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be levied at multiple rates ranging from 0 per cent to 28 per cent. GST Council finalised a four-tier GST tax structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, with lower rates for essential items and the highest for luxury and de-merits goods that would also attract an additional cess. Service Tax will go up from 15% to 18%. The services being taxed at lower rates, owing to the provision of abatement, such as train tickets, will fall in the lower slabs. In order to control inflation, essential items including food, which presently constitute roughly half of the consumer inflation basket, will be taxed at zero rate. The lowest rate of 5% would be for common use items. There would be two standard rates of 12 per cent and 18 per cent, which would fall on the bulk of the goods and services. This includes fast-moving consumer goods. Highest tax slab will be applicable to items which are currently taxed at 30-31% (excise duty plus VAT). Ultra luxuries, demerit and sin goods (like tobacco and aerated drinks), will attract a cess for a period of five years on top of the 28 per cent GST. The collection from this cess as well as that of the clean energy cess would create a revenue pool which would be used for compensating states for any loss of revenue during the first five years of implementation of GST. Finance minister said that the cess would be lapsable after five years. The structure to agreed is a compromise to accommodate demand for highest tax rate of 40% by states like Kerala. While the Centre proposed to levy a 4% GST on gold but the final decision on this was put off. During a press conference, finance minister Mr. Jaitley said, “GST rate on gold will be finalised after the fitting to the approved rates structure of all items is completed and there is some idea of revenue projections”. The principle for determining the rate on each item will be to levy and collect the GST at the rate slab closest to the current tax incidence on it. The GST will subsume the multitude of cesses currently in place, including the Swachh Bharat Cess , the Krishi Kalyan Cess and the Education Cess. Only the Clean Environment Cess is being retained, revenues from which will also fund the compensations. 2) What are CGST, SGST and IGST? India is a federal democracy that is one which has clear demarcation of powers, responsibility and revenue collection between the states and the centre in its constitution. For example law and order falls under the state’s jurisdiction while the nation’s defence is the centre’s responsibility. The GST too needs to have clear provisions on what areas the centre and the state are allowed to collect revenue from taxation to prevent an overlapping. The Central GST or CGST is the areas where the centre has the powers and State GST where the State has taxation capabilities. The IGST or Integrated GST is for movement of goods within the states of the Indian union. This will be collected by the union however will be transferred over to the states. Thus it is essential that if and when the GST comes out it is rolled over in the entire nation simultaneously. 3) What are the differences between the UPA’s GST and the NDA’s GST? Below are the primary differences: Petroleum sector has been kept out of the ambit of GST Liquor for human consumption is exempt however tobacco and tobacco products will fall under GST. There is a 1% tax on top of the GST for inter-state movement of goods and services. 4) What are the taxes that GST replaces? The GST replaces numerous different indirect taxes such as: Central Excise Duty Service Tax Countervailing Duty Special Countervailing Duty Value Added Tax (VAT) Central Sales Tax (CST) Octroi Entertainment Tax Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Advertisement taxes Taxes applicable on lotteries. 5) What will be the short-term impact of GST? The GST will fuel inflation for the short term. The GST rate starts at 5% and 18% taxation services such as restaurants, movies etc. are bound to increase prices. Another problem with the GST that many pundits feel is not including liquor and petroleum under GST’s ambit. These are major revenue sources for the government and experts feel this is being done due to a few crony capitalists who need some time to funnel away their black money as the GST promises to widen the tax paying population. Also read – Impact on GST on E-Commerce 6) When will GST be implemented? Government may not be able to meet the initial GST implementation date of 1st April 2017. Its widely assumed that GST rollout will start only after 1 July 2017. Keep checking the article for latest updates. 7) What is a constitutional amendment? A Constitutional Amendment as the name suggests is any change in the Constitution. A democracy like India derives all its rules and laws from the Constitution and hence any change in the Constitution is a change in the fundamental fabric of the country. The GST is the One Hundred and Twenty Second such proposed amendment and hence is named The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014. In simple terms bills other than the Constitution Amendment Bill are just modifications to topics that area already mentioned in the constitution. The introduction of a few new IITs is a perfect example. All these require are a simple majority in both the houses and the President’s Approval. However the GST requires a Constitution Amendment Bill which is a direct change in the Constitution and requires two-thirds of the votes in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. 8) What are the finer points in the implementation of the bill? Several committees were setup to evaluate the feasibility and implementation of the GST. Some fine points which were considered are: The problem of separating the taxation powers of the state and the centre which resulted in CGST and SGST. Exemptions from the GST which currently includes Petroleum and Liquor for human consumption. GST will be applicable on imports too along with the Basic Customs Duty which has not been scrapped. The GST will be applicable at the point of sale. In comparison the Value Added Tax is a destination based tax while excise duties are taxed at the origin. The workings in the implementation of IGST. 9) What is the Empowered Committee? The Empowered Committee is a committee of the Finance Ministers of the states. It was set up by the Vajpayee Government to look into the Value Added Tax model. The committee has had an influential hand in shaping and structuring of the GST. 10) What will become costlier and cheaper? According to experts, these items could become costlier: Cigarette prices likely to go up as GST rate for tobacco will be higher than current duties Commercial vehicles such as trucks will become costlier Mobile phone calls may get costlier as service tax will go up Textile and branded jewellery may become costlier And these could become cheaper: Auto: Prices of entry-level cars, two-wheelers, SUVs may fall Car batteries likely to get cheaper Paint, cement prices likely to fall Movie ticket prices likely to fall as entertainment tax will come down Electronics items like fans, lighting, water heaters, air coolers, etc. will get cheaper Effective date of GST will be 1st July 2017 once the bill is passed in Rajyasabha.

GST is a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition, which makes GST essentially a tax only on value addition at each stage. The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages. Question 2. What are the benefits of GST? Answer :The benefits of GST can be summarized as under: For business and industry o Easy compliance : A robust and comprehensive IT system would be the foundation of the GST regime in India. Therefore, all tax payer services such as registrations, returns, payments, etc. would be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent. o Uniformity of tax rates and structures : GST will ensure that indirect tax rates and structures are common across the country, thereby increasing certainty and ease of doing business. In other words, GST would make doing business in the country tax neutral, irrespective of the choice of place of doing business. o Removal of cascading : A system of seamless tax-credits throughout the value-chain, and across boundaries of States, would ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business. o Improved competitiveness: Reduction in transaction costs of doing business would eventually lead to an improved competitiveness for the trade and industry. o Gain to manufacturers and exporters : The subsuming of major Central and State taxes in GST, complete and comprehensive set-off of input goods and services and phasing out of Central Sales Tax (CST) would reduce the cost of locally manufactured goods and services. This will increase the competitiveness of Indian goods and services in the international market and give boost to Indian exports. The uniformity in tax rates and procedures across the country will also go a long way in reducing the compliance cost. For Central and State Governments o Simple and easy to administer : Multiple indirect taxes at the Central and State levels are being replaced by GST. Backed with a robust end-to-end IT system, GST would be simpler and easier to administer than all other indirect taxes of the Centre and State levied so far. o Better controls on leakage: GST will result in better tax compliance due to a robust IT infrastructure. Due to the seamless transfer of input tax credit from one stage to another in the chain of value addition, there is an in-built mechanism in the design of GST that would incentivize tax compliance by traders. o Higher revenue efficiency: GST is expected to decrease the cost of collection of tax revenues of the Government, and will therefore, lead to higher revenue efficiency. For the consumer o Single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services: Due to multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and State, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition, the cost of most goods and services in the country today are laden with many hidden taxes. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer. o Relief in overall tax burden: Because of efficiency gains and prevention of leakages, the overall tax burden on most commodities will come down, which will benefit consumers. Question 3. Which taxes at the Centre and State level are being subsumed into GST? Answer : At the Central level, the following taxes are being subsumed: Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, and Special Additional Duty of Customs. At the State level, the following taxes are being subsumed: Subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States), Octroi and Entry tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury tax, and Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling. Question 4. What are the major chronological events that have led to the introduction of GST? Answer : GST is being introduced in the country after a 13 year long journey since it was first discussed in the report of the Kelkar Task Force on indirect taxes. A brief chronology outlining the major milestones on the proposal for introduction of GST in India is as follows: In 2003, the Kelkar Task Force on indirect tax had suggested a comprehensive Goods and Services Tax (GST) based on VAT principle. A proposal to introduce a National level Goods and Services Tax (GST) by April 1, 2010 was first mooted in the Budget Speech for the financial year 2006-07. Since the proposal involved reform/ restructuring of not only indirect taxes levied by the Centre but also the States, the responsibility of preparing a Design and Road Map for the implementation of GST was assigned to the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). Based on inputs from Govt of India and States, the EC released its First Discussion Paper on Goods and Services Tax in India in November, 2009. In order to take the GST related work further, a Joint Working Group consisting of officers from Central as well as State Government was constituted in September, 2009. In order to amend the Constitution to enable introduction of GST, the Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha in March 2011. As per the prescribed procedure, the Bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Finance of the Parliament for examination and report. Meanwhile, in pursuance of the decision taken in a meeting between the Union Finance Minister and the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on 8th November, 2012, a ‘Committee on GST Design’, consisting of the officials of the Government of India, State Governments and the Empowered Committee was constituted. This Committee did a detailed discussion on GST design including the Constitution (115th) Amendment Bill and submitted its report in January, 2013. Based on this Report, the EC recommended certain changes in the Constitution Amendment Bill in their meeting at Bhubaneswar in January 2013. The Empowered Committee in the Bhubaneswar meeting also decided to constitute three committees of officers to discuss and report on various aspects of GST as follows:- (a) Committee on Place of Supply Rules and Revenue Neutral Rates; (b) Committee on dual control, threshold and exemptions; (c) Committee on IGST and GST on imports. The Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted its Report in August, 2013 to the Lok Sabha. The recommendations of the Empowered Committee and the recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee were examined in the Ministry in consultation with the Legislative Department. Most of the recommendations made by the Empowered Committee and the Parliamentary Standing Committee were accepted and the draft Amendment Bill was suitably revised. The final draft Constitutional Amendment Bill incorporating the above stated changes were sent to the Empowered Committee for consideration in September 2013. The EC once again made certain recommendations on the Bill after its meeting in Shillong in November 2013. Certain recommendations of the Empowered Committee were incorporated in the draft Constitution (115th Amendment) Bill. The revised draft was sent for consideration of the Empowered Committee in March, 2014. The 115th Constitutional (Amendment) Bill, 2011, for the introduction of GST introduced in the Lok Sabha in March 2011 lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha. In June 2014, the draft Constitution Amendment Bill was sent to the Empowered Committee after approval of the new Government. Based on a broad consensus reached with the Empowered Committee on the contours of the Bill, the Cabinet on 17.12.2014 approved the proposal for introduction of a Bill in the Parliament for amending the Constitution of India to facilitate the introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in the country. The Bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 19.12.2014, and was passed by the Lok Sabha on 06.05.2015. It was then referred to the Select Committee of Rajya Sabha, which submitted its report on 22.07.2015. Question 5.How would GST be administered in India? Answer: Keeping in mind the federal structure of India, there will be two components of GST – Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST). Both Centre and States will simultaneously levy GST across the value chain. Tax will be levied on every supply of goods and services. Centre would levy and collect Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST), and States would levy and collect the State Goods and Services Tax (SGST) on all transactions within a State. The input tax credit of CGST would be available for discharging the CGST liability on the output at each stage. Similarly, the credit of SGST paid on inputs would be allowed for paying the SGST on output. No cross utilization of credit would be permitted. Question 6.How would a particular transaction of goods and services be taxed simultaneously under Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST)? Answer :The Central GST and the State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except on exempted goods and services, goods which are outside the purview of GST and the transactions which are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further, both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of Central Excise. A diagrammatic representation of the working of the Dual GST model within a State is shown in Figure 1 below. Figure 1: GST within State Question 7.Will cross utilization of credits between goods and services be allowed under GST regime? Answer :Cross utilization of credit of CGST between goods and services would be allowed. Similarly, the facility of cross utilization of credit will be available in case of SGST. However, the cross utilization of CGST and SGST would not be allowed except in the case of inter-State supply of goods and services under the IGST model which is explained in answer to the next question. Question 8.How will be Inter-State Transactions of Goods and Services be taxed under GST in terms of IGST method? Answer :In case of inter-State transactions, the Centre would levy and collect the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on all inter-State supplies of goods and services under Article 269A (1) of the Constitution. The IGST would roughly be equal to CGST plus SGST. The IGST mechanism has been designed to ensure seamless flow of input tax credit from one State to another. The inter-State seller would pay IGST on the sale of his goods to the Central Government after adjusting credit of IGST, CGST and SGST on his purchases (in that order). The exporting State will transfer to the Centre the credit of SGST used in payment of IGST. The importing dealer will claim credit of IGST while discharging his output tax liability (both CGST and SGST) in his own State. The Centre will transfer to the importing State the credit of IGST used in payment of SGST.Since GST is a destination-based tax, all SGST on the final product will ordinarily accrue to the consuming State. A diagrammatic representation of the working of the IGST model for inter-State transactions is shown in Figure 2 below. Figure 2 Question 9.How will IT be used for the implementation of GST? Answer: For the implementation of GST in the country, the Central and State Governments have jointly registered Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) as a not-for-profit, non-Government Company to provide shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders. The key objectives of GSTN are to provide a standard and uniform interface to the taxpayers, and shared infrastructure and services to Central and State/UT governments. GSTN is working on developing a state-of-the-art comprehensive IT infrastructure including the common GST portal providing frontend services of registration, returns and payments to all taxpayers, as well as the backend IT modules for certain States that include processing of returns, registrations, audits, assessments, appeals, etc. All States, accounting authorities, RBI and banks, are also preparing their IT infrastructure for the administration of GST. There would no manual filing of returns. All taxes can also be paid online. All mis-matched returns would be auto-generated, and there would be no need for manual interventions. Most returns would be self-assessed. Question 10.How will imports be taxed under GST? Answer :The Additional Duty of Excise or CVD and the Special Additional Duty or SAD presently being levied on imports will be subsumed under GST. As per explanation to clause (1) of article 269A of the Constitution, IGST will be levied on all imports into the territory of India. Unlike in the present regime, the States where imported goods are consumed will now gain their share from this IGST paid on imported goods. Question 11. What are the major features of the Constitution (122 nd Amendment) Bill, 2014? Answer :The salient features of the Bill are as follows: Conferring simultaneous power upon Parliament and the State Legislatures to make laws governing goods and services tax; Subsuming of various Central indirect taxes and levies such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duties, Service Tax, Additional Customs Duty commonly known as Countervailing Duty, and Special Additional Duty of Customs; Subsuming of State Value Added Tax/Sales Tax, Entertainment Tax (other than the tax levied by the local bodies), Central Sales Tax (levied by the Centre and collected by the States), Octroi and Entry tax, Purchase Tax, Luxury tax, and Taxes on lottery, betting and gambling; Dispensing with the concept of ‘declared goods of special importance’ under the Constitution; Levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on inter-State transactions of goods and services; GST to be levied on all goods and services, except alcoholic liquor for human consumption.

Question 12. What are the major features of the proposed registration procedures under GST? Answer :The major features of the proposed registration procedures under GST are as follows: Existing dealers : Existing VAT/Central excise/Service Tax payers will not have to apply afresh for registration under GST. New dealers : Single application to be filed online for registration under GST. iii. The registration number will be PAN based and will serve the purpose for Centre and State.

What are the major features of the proposed returns filing procedures under GST? Answer: The major features of the proposed returns filing procedures under GST are as follows: Common return would serve the purpose of both Centre and State Government.

[7] [8] In his budget speech on 28 February 2006, P. Chidambaram , the then Finance Minister, announced the target date for implementation of GST to be 1 April 2010 and formed another empowered committee of State Finance Ministers to design the road map. The committee submitted its report to the government in April 2008 and released its First Discussion Paper on GST in India in 2009. [7] Since the proposal involved reform/ restructuring of not only indirect taxes levied by the Central but also the States, the responsibility of preparing a Design and Road Map for the implementation of GST was assigned to the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers (EC). In April, 2008, the EC submitted a report, titled ""A Model and Road map for Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India"" containing broad recommendations about the structure and design of GST. In response to the report, the Department of Revenue made some suggestions to be incorporated in the design and structure of proposed GST bill . Based on inputs from GoI and States, The EC released its First Discussion Paper on Goods and Services Tax in India on 10 November 2009 with the objective of generating a debate and obtaining inputs from all stakeholders. A dual GST module for the country has been proposed by the EC. This dual GST model has been accepted by centre. Under this model GST have two components viz. the Central GST to be levied and collected by the Centre and the State GST to be levied and collected by the respective States. Central Excise duty, additional excise duty, Service Tax, and additional duty of customs (equivalent to excise), State VAT, entertainment tax, taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling and entry tax (not levied by local bodies) would be subsumed within GST. Other taxes which will be subsumed with GST are Octroi, entry tax and luxury tax thus making it a single indirect tax in India. [9] In order to take the GST related work further, a Joint Working Group consisting of officers from Central as well as State Government was constituted. This was further trifurcated into three Sub-Working Groups to work separately on draft legislation required for GST, process/forms to be followed in GST regime and IT infrastructure development needed for smooth functioning of proposed GST. In addition, an Empowered Group for development of IT Systems required for Goods and Services Tax regime has been set up under the chairmanship of Dr. Nandan Nilekani.Amendmentee Legislative history [ edit ] 29 March 2017 CGST , IGST, UTGST and GST compensation law passed in Loksabha [10] The Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment) Bill, 2014 was introduced in the Lok Sabha by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on 19 December 2014, and passed by the House on 6 May 2015.

Bank account users, hence, will have to be prepared to shell out more. Madhuchanda Dey Moneycontrol Research The banking sector, one of the largest service sectors in the country, will have to put in plenty of hard work to get Goods and Service Tax (GST)-ready. While the change in tax rate is grabbing the headlines, that is actually one of the many changes to which banks will have to adjust. For most categories of chargeable banking services, the effective tax rate will become 18 percent from the current 15 percent (at present it includes Swachh Bharat and Krishi Kalyan Cess). Banks will definitely pass on this extra levy on to the customers. As users of banking services, prepare to shell out a bit more. Lower ITC than manufacturing Since banking companies provide a lot of taxable and tax exempt services and it since may be tedious to maintain details of taxable and exempt services every month, the government has provided them an option to comply with the provisions of Input Tax Credit (ITC) reversal on proper calculations or avail of 50 percent of the eligible input tax credit on inputs, capital goods and input services, with the rest lapsing. Higher compliance requirements At present banks discharge their service tax compliances through a single 'centralised' registration. However, under GST, they would have to take separate registrations for each state where they operate. In addition, there will be an increase in the periodicity of returns, number of return formats and level of details required in these returns. According to Siva Subramaniam, Product Head – Banking & Financial Services at SunTec Business Solutions, “Manufacturing companies were used to paying state-wise VAT, but banks are centralised, so they face more challenges under GST.” Banks need to define – origin and destination GST is a consumption-based tax regime. Hence, for every transaction in GST, the bank will need to determine the place of consumption where GST will be paid. With bank branches conducting several transactions, both within and outside states, determining the place of supply will not be a very easy task. The Model GST Law casts the onus of determining whether a transaction is intra-state or inter-state on the assessee. So, banks will need to decide whether the payment is against Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST) or Integrated GST (IGST), based on the type of transaction. Moreover, inter-state supplies of goods or services (or both) between two branches of the same bank, located in two States, will also attract IGST. The GST charged will be available as credit to the receiving branch; however, tracking such transactions could prove to be a cumbersome task. Banks will have to have the GST-ready infrastructure in place. Unlike manufacturing, banks typically have multiple softwares for different lines of businesses and will need to have a GST-ready solution on top for each. Availing services of unregistered vendors Another area that may have to be reviewed by banks is taking services from unregistered vendors. While the rules so far specifies that companies availing of services from unregistered vendors (turnover less than Rs 20 lakhs) will be subject to reverse charges (where the recipient is liable to pay tax), as of now there is no clarity if reverse charge qualifies for Input Tax Credit. The government may also specify the limit for availing supplies from unregistered suppliers. Define jurisdiction of the services availed The complexity is not just about services rendered but also the services that the banks avail. There has to be a specification of the jurisdiction of the services consumed say between branches (according to states) and the head office. For instance, if a bank avails of advertising services from an advertising agency, it has to specify the percentage distribution of this service across states. The concept of Input Service Distributor (ISD) is provided in GST. It is defined as ‘an office which can be a head office, administrative office, corporate office, so on, belonging to registered taxable person who intends to distribute the credit’. Under GST, on an intrastate transaction, CGST and SGST will be applicable. In case of transaction within a union territory, CGST and UTGST will be applicable. IGST will be applicable in case of interstate transactions. Is the sector ready? Invoices will have to be uploaded before filing returns. But the above-mentioned backend readiness will have to happen before they file the first tax return on August 14. According to industry sources, many banks started the preparation as early as January to be ready by April. Private sector banks again have taken the lead in getting backends ready. While the incremental cost is unlikely to jolt numbers, bank employees should nevertheless brace for another round of sleepless nights coming close on the heels of the overtime work that they had to put in the aftermath of demonetisation. tags #Economy #GST #India Related news India Amit Shah in Gujarat tomorrow as BJP gears up for assembly polls May 30, 2017 10:50 PM Business IDBI Bank plans Rs 10,000 cr fund raise, to float rupee bonds May 30, 2017 10:50 PM India No conspiracy, mosque was brought down openly: Katiyar May 30, 2017 10:45 PM India UP govt seeks Belgium's help in cleaning of Ganga May 30, 2017 10:45 PM Business FM Arun Jaitley chairs 1st meeting to discuss financial year change May 30, 2017 09:59 PM Business 3 Years of Modi Government: Aviation sector hits & misses May 30, 2017 09:43 PM Business Uber India plans to create frictionless experience for riders, drivers May 30, 2017 09:10 PM Business GIC Re premium growth up 82% in FY17; plans IPO by FY17-end BY M Saraswathy May 30, 2017 09:08 PM Business CSO mulls online data collection for IIP May 30, 2017 08:58 PM News Most Popular Top News Early rains to shower hope for Sensex; top 10 stocks to chase this monsoon Tata Motors cuts up to 1,500 managerial jobs Mid & smallcap stocks crack; 10 stocks which can give up to 50% return This smallcap could pump more profits as it now starts to leverage its assets Trade Setup for Wednesday: Top 10 things you should know before Opening Bell Only GST Council empowered to punish profiteers; taxmen can suggest fines You may soon get to change banks and use the same account number Tata Sons chief N Chandrasekaran took home Rs 30 cr as TCS CEO in FY17 see more Video of the day Market punishing stocks whose valuations are not in sync with prices: Motilal Oswal Portfolio Markets Watchlist Live TV Show Currencies Commodities Fixed Income Personal Finance Mutual Fund Stock Market India IPO Global Market Budget 2017 BSE Sensex Forum News Business Markets Stocks Economy Mutual Funds Personal Finance IPO Startups Stocks : A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | Others Mutual Funds: A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z Visit the App Store to see all our apps: Tools Retirement Planning EMI Calculator SIP Calculator SIP Planner Useful Links Budget 2016 Live Sensex Public Sector Banks Best Portfolio Manager Small Savings Schemes Bonds Specials Master Your Money Game Changers Travelcafe SME Special Investment Watch PowerYourTrade MoneyBhai Focus Grow My Money GE Step Ahead SME Step Up Feedback & Info feedback@moneycontrol.com About us | Contact Us | Feedback | Disclaimer | Privacy Statement | Terms of Use | Careers | Financial Terms (Glossary) | FAQs | Sitemap | RSS Feed Copyright © e-Eighteen.com Ltd.

Salient Highlights Luxury hotels, gambling, race club betting and cinema services will attract a tax rate of 28%. Education, healthcare and non-AC rail travel will remain exempted from the GST tax regime. However, the states will be given the option to levy additional taxes on cinema to compensate for the revenue losses entailed due to merging of entertainment tax with GST. At present, the total tax incidence on cinema including entertainment and service tax is in the range of 55%. The states need to use the legislative route if it wants to levy additional tax on cinema. States will also be permitted to levy any new tax as the taxation powers of the states have only been restricted and not abolished after the rollout of GST. Telecom and financial services will be taxed at a rate of 18%. Transport services will be taxed at the rate of 5%. Cab aggregators like Ola and Uber will have to pay 5% under GST in place of 6%.

Tags: Economy • GST • GST Council • Ministry of Finance • National GST Council Announces GST Rates May 19, 2017 No comments The GST Council headed by finance Minister Arun Jaitley has finalised tax rates and has approved all the seven rules for the GST regime that is scheduled to be implemented from July 1. The remaining two rules of the GST pertaining to transition and return is under the examination of the legal committee. In total, the council has fixed the rates of 1211 items. It will decide rates of some other items and services in the coming days. Salient Highlights Out of 1211 items, 81% of the items will attract tax of 18% or less. Only the remaining 19% of items will attract a highest rate of 28% Household items like Sugar, Tea, Coffee and edible oil will attract 5% levy. Cereals and milk will be exempted from the tax. Manufactured goods will attract 18% levy. Luxury cars will attract 28% GST in addition to a cess of 15%. Small petrol cars will attract 28% GST plus a 1% cess, and diesel cars will be taxed at 28% plus 3% cess. Capital goods, a key asset for the manufacturing sector, will be taxed at 28%. Aerated drinks will fall under the 28% tax bracket. Significance The GST Council has not increased the overall tax in any of the 1211 items but have reduced tax on many items. For example, Soap, which is now taxed at the rate of 22-24%, will be taxed at 18%. The present tax incidence in excess of 28% on luxury items will be treated as cess and will be deposited in the corpus for compensating states if they suffer any revenue loss. Food items are expected to become cheaper. Daily use items like hair oil, toothpaste, and soap are kept in the 18% tax slab instead of 28%. The cost of energy generation is expected to become less as tax incidence on coal has been reduced from 11% to 5%. GST regime is expected to unify the whole of the country into a common market eliminating both Central and State levies. Also, GST is expected to i ncrease state and federal tax revenues, ease inflation and boost economic growth by 1-2% points in the medium term. Tags: Business • Economy • GST • GST Council • GST Rates • National • States President Gives Assent to Four GST Legislations April 13, 2017 No comments President Pranab Mukherjee has given assent to four supporting legislations on Goods and Services Tax (GST). The four legislations are: The Central GST Act, 2017, The Integrated GST Act, 2017, The GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, and The Union Territory GST Act, 2017. The above bills were passed in Rajya Sabha on April 6 th and in Lok Sabha on 29 March. Now with the President’s assent, these bills will pave way for the roll-out of GST regime from 1 July. The Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 , deals with the levy of the Central Goods and Services Tax by the union government over the supply of goods and services within the boundary of a state. The Integrated GST Act, 2017 , provides for the levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax by the union government on the interstate supply of goods and services. The Goods and Services Tax (Compensation to States) Act, 2017 , provides for compensation for the losses incurred by the states on account of implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. The Union Territory GST Act, 2017 , provides for the levy and collection of tax on intra-state supply of goods, services or both, by the Union Territories. Jammu & Kashmir GST regime will not be applicable to Jammu and Kashmir because of the fact that Article 370 gives special status to the state. So, the state will have to legislate its own law and integrate with the GST regime. GST Goods and Services Tax is a comprehensive indirect tax which is to be levied on the manufacture, sale and consumption of goods and services in India. This is so far the biggest tax reform in the country. GST will subsume central excise, service tax, Value Added Tax (VAT) and other local levies to create a uniform market. GST eliminates the cascading effect of taxes because it is taxed at every point of business and the input credit is available in the value chain. The tax rates under GST regime will be based on the recommendation GST Council. Council has two-thirds voting by States and one-third by Centre.

GST Registration If you run a business in New Zealand or provide sales/services in New Zealand and your turnover for the last 12 months was more than $60,000, you must register for GST.

A tax invoice must contain the following information: Name and address of the supplier The words ""tax invoice"" The supplier's GST number The date of issue The name and address of the recipient A brief description of the goods and/or services supplied Amount, excluding tax,charged for the supply Total amount payable (including GST) A note stating that the total amount payable includes GST Here's how you can configure invoice settings to comply with the requirements mentioned above. Configuring New Zealand GST in Chargebee This section will walk you through configuring GST in Chargebee: Step 1: Update your organization address Make sure you've added your organization address at Settings > Site info . You cannot configure taxes in Chargebee without completing this step in your initial setup. Step 2: Enable Tax Go to Settings > Taxes and click the Enable Tax option. Step 3: Choose a Price Type for NZD Once taxes are enabled, you will be redirected to a page containing all the currencies that you have enabled for your site . Step 3 is configuring a price type (the price that you quote for your product/service/addon can be either inclusive of tax, where tax is included in the price, or exclusive of tax, where tax is added to the price) for each of these currencies. IR regulation calls for the price of your product to be inclusive of GST. Choosing a tax inclusive price type here will ensure that GST is always included in the final price shown in the invoices. Note If you are selling to New Zealand in a different currency, check out how to configure price type for a region so your invoices are aligned with regulation here. Step 3a: Consistent Pricing If you are selling to customers across around the world and would want to charge them the same price for your product regardless of the taxes applicable as per the customer's location, use the Consistent Pricing option. This option allows you to have a flat-rate charge for your product or service, regardless of the taxes applicable and the customer's country/region. This means that no matter what tax rate is applicable for a sale, the final invoice amount for your product or service will be the same. Further customization within consistent pricing: Reduce the price for non-configured regions by removing the tax included What happens to your tax-inclusive consistent price when selling to customers residing outside your taxable region or countries where you haven't registered for tax? Enable this option if you would like your consistent price to apply to them as well. In this case, tax will not be applied and the price will be shown as a whole. In case of exemptions, reduce the price by removing the included tax instead of destination tax What happens to your tax-inclusive consistent price when selling to customers who are tax exempt? Do not enable this option if you would like your consistent price to apply to them as well. Step 4: Click Add Region and select New Zealand Click on Add Region and select ‘New Zealand' from the region list. You will now be redirected to a GST configuration page. Step 5: Enter your tax registration number Enter your tax registration number (the GST number assigned to you when you registered - this may be the same as your IRD number) and your Tax Registration Label (GST) here. Note GST regulation calls for your GST number to displayed on your invoices. You can enable your tax registration number to be displayed at the Invoice customization page. Step 6: Location Validation: Enable or Disable Location validation based on how you want to collect and store your customers' address proof. As per IR regulations, you need to ensure that the customers or businesses you are selling to are, in fact, residing in New Zealand. Your customers are required to provide two non-conflicting pieces of evidence that indicate the same. The following count as valid pieces of evidence of residence: Your customer's billing address. The internet protocol (IP) address of the device that your customer is using. The customer's bank details, including information of the account your customer is using for payment. The location of the customer's fixed land line through which the service is supplied to them. From the list mentioned, Chargebee uses the following to collect, validate and store location information. Customer's IP Address : Hosted Pages If you have integrated with Chargebee using the hosted pages, the IP Address of the customer will be collected automatically. API If you use the Chargebee API, you will have to pass the IP Address of the customer to Chargebee using the User Details Header API. Card BIN of the Customer : The first six digits of a card constitute the Bank Identification Number (BIN). BIN gives us the information about the card issuing bank and hence can be used as a way to determine the customer's location. Hosted Pages If you have integrated with Chargebee using the hosted pages, the BIN of the customer will be collected automatically. API If you use the Chargebee API, you will have to pass the BIN of the customer using the card [number] parameter in the Create a Customer API. Note If the location validation fails, the customer will not be able to complete the order. Location Validation Failure If your customer's location validation fails, he will not be able to complete his order. He will receive the following error message: If a customer signs up for a trial plan which involves no immediate payment, the subscription is created irrespective of whether the location validation was successful or not. The details of the customer are marked with a warning indicating that the location validation failed. Step 7: Add your tax rates Depending on whether you sell digital or physical products, you will need to provide a label and the tax rate that you would like Chargebee to apply to your invoices. As per IR regulation, you should set your tax rate to 15%. In this page GST Rules Configuring New Zealand GST in Chargebee www.chargebee.com © Copyright 2016, Chargebee Inc. Loading… "

Published May 30, 2017, 1:57 am IST Updated May 30, 2017, 2:37 am IST Star hotels will not support the bandh. About 40 per cent of messes, tiffin centres and other eateries that have an annual turnover of over Rs 20 lakh will observe the bandh. Hyderabad: Nearly 40,000 hotels and restaurants will stay closed on Tuesday to protest the higher tax slab prescribed under the new GST regime, which will come into force from July 1. Star hotels will not support the bandh. About 40 per cent of messes, tiffin centres and other eateries that have an annual turnover of over Rs 20 lakh will observe the bandh. The remaining 60 per cent of establishments that have a turnover of less than Rs 20 lakh and so do not fall under the ambit of GST will continue to function as usual. Bakeries and sweet shops with an annual turnover of over Rs 20 lakh have also extended support to the bandh. The GST Council has fixed 12 per cent and 18 per cent tax slabs under GST on hotels and restaurants. The hotels and restaurants industry wants the tax to be a uniform 5 per cent. South Indian States Hotels Association (SISHA) will participate in the bandh on May 30 while the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Associa-tion of India has given a call to hold a dharna on June 1 at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. The TS Hotels Association has extended support to the agitation programmes of SISHA. Hotels sought uniform tax under GST TS Hotels' Association president S Venkata Reddy said, “We have submitted repeated representations to the Centre and state government seeking uniform tax rate of 5 per cent in the GST regime. But the GST Council fixed differential tax rates based on turnover. We strongly oppose this as it will adversely affect the hotel and hospitality industry.” The GST Council had prescribed 5 per cent tax for businesses with a turnover of below Rs 20 lakh per annum, 12 per cent tax for those with a turnover between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 50 lakh and non-AC restaurants and 18 per cent tax for all AC restaurants. At present, 5 per cent VAT is imposed on hotels with a turnover below Rs 1.50 crore per month and 14.5 per cent for those with a turnover above Rs 1.50 crore. All hotels collect uniform 5.6 per cent service tax. Mr Reddy said due to lowering of turnover, a majority of hotels in the state will fall in the 12 per cent and 18 per cent tax categories, unlike at present where they fall in the under 5 per cent tax category.

According to data accessed by The Hindu , a maximum number of 93.27% of the more than 5.50 lakh taxpayers in the Karnataka have enrolled for GST. However, the numbers are not so encouraging for most of the north-eastern States,and Jammu and Kashmir. Karnataka is followed by Gujarat, where 90.18% of the nearly 5 lakh taxpayers have enrolled for the new system. In Chandigarh, which has 16,305 tax payers, 91.04% have enrolled for GST, followed by Andhra Pradesh (88.6% of more than 2.29 lakh taxpayers), Maharashtra (87.80% of more than 8 lakh taxpayers) and Tamil Nadu (87.29% of over 6.30 lakh taxpayers). Other States that have more than 80 per cent enrolment for the new system are Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. However, while in J&K only 4.92% of the more than 58,000 taxpayers have enrolled, for Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, the percentage stands at 28.10% (of 5,476 taxpayers) and 27.92% (of more than 2 lakh taxpayers) respectively. Manipur has recorded 45.41% of 3,940 taxpayers, Meghalaya (19.39% of 24,296 taxpayers), Mizoram (37.53% of 2,313) and Nagaland (58.22% of 4,847).

Issues that matter Infrastructure Women's Safety Farmers Suicide Sports All Brands Tata Tea Premium Tata Tea Gold Tata Tea Agni Tata Tea Veda Subscribe Select Category Women Empowerment And Issues How Acts And Laws Work Elections Know Your Police Current Issues Budget Expert Speak THE IMPACT OF GST (GOODS AND SERVICES TAX) IN INDIA The Lok Sabha has finally Passed the Goods and Services Tax Bill and it is expected to have a significant impact on every industry and every consumer. Apart from filling the loopholes of the current system, it is also aimed at boosting the Indian economy. This will be done by simplifying and unifying the indirect taxes for all states throughout India. Let us have a look a few things that will be influenced by the GST. What will be expensive: Eating Out Dining out will be expensive. Here’s an example explaining how - In a restaurant, say a consumer spends Rs.100. Currently you pay an average of 18.5% as service tax and VAT. So apart from the service charge, you usually shell out Rs 118.5. Now, according to GST, it’s expected that the rates can be fixed at 18 to 20%. Accordingly at 20% approximate tax rate, your bill will be 120 rupees. Phone Bills Suppose on a bill of Rs 100 on which consumer pays service tax of 15 % and finally pays Rs 115 as total amount to his service provider. After GST, if the tax rate is fixed at 18 % then he will have to bear the brunt of Rs 118. After implementation of GST, internet packs and call rates are likely to get higher. Jewellery The yellow metal too is all set to become expensive . At this point of time, only 2% tax is paid by the buyers, but sadly though, according to GST at least 6 % is expected to be paid by buyers. This will impact jewellery sales. Online Shopping Don't be surprised if E-commerce companies abruptly stop giving discounts & freebies that they offer. For every purchase from its sellers, the e commerce companies will pay a fixed TDS . Consequently, the cost for example commerce will increase. This will affect sales as customers will be expected to shell out more money for the same goods. Banking & Insurance Services offered by banks are taxed at 14.5% currently which under GST regime are likely to become costlier at standard rate of 17-18% . Several services by bank to a customer are centralized or localized. These complexities add to compliance costs, making it expensive for consumers. Travelling Air tickets to will become expensive post the implementation of the GST. Service tax on airline fares ranges between 6%-9%. GST will pump the taxes up further to 15%-17% What will be cheaper: Buying a car The luxury of a car will now seem reachable for the common man. Buying a car will be hassle free in different states with same prices everywhere. So a Rs.5 lakh car with excise duty of 12.5 % and with VAT roughly totals to Rs 6.25 lakh. Now under the GST, it is expected to get lower up till Rs 35,000. If the rate is fixed at 18%, the price will now be Rs 5.9 lakhs. Automobile industry looks upwards. Televisions Currently a buyer shells out Rs 20,000 for a basic LED TV plus 24.5 % tax making the total cost rise to Rs 24,900. As GST will be around 18 to 20 %, the buyer will now approximately pay Rs 23,600. Movie Tickets Entertainment Taxes are likely to reduce by 2-4%. Multiplex chains will increase revenues as current high rate of entertainment tax will be uniform in all parts of the country. Lower the ticket price, higher the ticket sales. Even film producers will benefit from this advancement. Processed Foods Companies manufacturing processed food pay various taxes summing up to 24%-25%. With GST, it’ll sum up to 17%-19%. Such great savings from the taxes may issue a decrease in prices of products, making it cheaper for end consumers. Cement Tax for cement is 25%. With GST it will become 18%-20%. With logistics cost also decreasing, cement depots will also decrease. Overall cost will also decrease. If implemented well, GST can help boost India’s economy and help make the process of levying indirect taxes more streamlined. What do you think about GST?

IndiaToday.in | Posted by Vivek Surendran desk-itgd@intoday.com New Delhi, May 29, 2017 | UPDATED 11:22 IST A + A - 1) What is Goods and Services Tax (GST)? It is a destination based tax on consumption of goods and services. It is proposed to be levied at all stages right from manufacture up to final consumption with credit of taxes paid at previous stages available as set off. In a nutshell, only value addition will be taxed and burden of tax is to be borne by the final consumer. 2) What exactly is the concept of destination based tax on consumption? The tax would accrue to the taxing authority which has jurisdiction over the place of consumption which is also termed as place of supply. 3) Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be subsumed under GST? The GST would replace the following taxes: (i) Taxes currently levied and collected by the Centre: Central Excise duty Duties of Excise (Medicinal and Toilet Preparations) Additional Duties of Excise (Goods of Special Importance) Additional Duties of Excise (Textiles and Textile Products) Additional Duties of Customs (commonly known as CVD) Special Additional Duty of Customs (SAD) Service Tax. Central Surcharges and Cesses so far as they relate to supply of goods and services (ii) State taxes that would be subsumed under the GST are: State VAT Central Sales Tax Luxury Taxd. Entry Tax (all forms) Entertainment and Amusement Tax (except when levied by the local bodies) Taxes on advertisements Purchase Tax. Taxes on lotteries, betting and gambling. State Surcharges and Cesses so far as they are late to supply of goods and services. The GST Council shall make recommendations to the Union and States on the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States and the local bodies which may be subsumed in the GST. 4) What principles were adopted for subsuming the above taxes under GST? The various Central, State and Local levies were examined to identify their possibility of being subsumed under GST. While identifying, the following principles were kept in mind: (i) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be primarily in the nature of indirect taxes, either on the supply of goods or on the supply of services. (ii) Taxes or levies to be subsumed should be part of the transaction chain which commences with import/manufacture/ production of goods or provision of services at one end and the consumption of goods and services at the other. (iii) The subsumation should result in free flow of tax credit in intra and inter-State levels. The taxes, levies and fees that are not specifically related to supply of goods and services should not be subsumed under GST. (v) Revenue fairness for both the Union and the States individually would need to be attempted. 5) Which are the commodities proposed to be kept outside the purview of GST? Article 366(12A) of the Constitution as amended by 101st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2016 defines the Goods and Services tax (GST) as a tax on supply of goods or services or both, except supply of alcoholic liquor for human consumption. So alcohol for human consumption is kept out of GST by way of definition of GST in constitution. Five petroleum products viz. petroleum crude, motor spirit (petrol), high speed diesel, natural gas and aviation turbine fuel have temporarily been kept out and GST Council shall decide the date from which they shall be included in GST. Furthermore, electricity has been kept out of GST. 6) What will be the status in respect of taxation of above commodities after introduction of GST? The existing taxation system (VAT and Central Excise) will continue in respect of the above commodities. 7) What will be status of Tobacco and Tobacco products under the GST regime? Tobacco and tobacco products would be subject to GST. In addition, the Centre would have the power to levy Central Excise duty on these products. 8) What type of GST is proposed to be implemented? It would be a dual GST with the Centre and States simultaneously levying it on a common tax base. The GST to be levied by the Centre on intra-State supply of goods and / or services would be called the Central GST (CGST) and that to be levied by the States/ Union territory would be called the State GST (SGST)/ UTGST. Similarly, Integrated GST (IGST) will be levied and administered by Centre on every inter-state supply of goods and services. 9) Why is Dual GST required? India is a federal country where both the Centre and the States have been assigned the powersto levy and collect taxes through appropriate legislation. Both the levels of Government have distinct responsibilities to perform according to the division of powers prescribed in the Constitution for which they need to raise resources. A dual GST will, therefore, be in keeping with the Constitutional requirement of fiscal federalism. 10) Which authority will levy and administer GST? Centre will levy and administer CGST and IGST while respective states/UTs will levy and administer SGST/UTGST. 11) Why was the Constitution of India amended recently in the context of GST? Currently, the fiscal powers between the Centre and the States are clearly demarcated in the Constitution with almost no overlap between the respective domains. The Centre has the powers to levy tax on the manufacture of goods (except alcoholic liquor for human consumption, opium, narcotics etc.) while the States have the powers to levy tax on the sale of goods. In the case of inter-State sales, the Centre has the power to levy a tax (the Central Sales Tax) but, the tax is collected and retained entirely by the States. As for services, it is the Centre alone that is empowered to levy service tax. Introduction of the GST required amendments in the Constitution so as to simultaneously empower the Centre and the States to levy and collect this tax. The Constitution of India has been amended by the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 for this purpose. Article 246A of the Constitution empowers the Centre and the States to levy and collect the GST. 12. How a particular transaction of goods and services would be taxed simultaneously under Central GST (CGST) and State GST (SGST) The Central GST and the State GST would be levied simultaneously on every transaction of supply of goods and services except the exempted goods and services, goods which are outside the purview of GST and the transactions which are below the prescribed threshold limits. Further, both would be levied on the same price or value unlike State VAT which is levied on the value of the goods inclusive of CENVAT. While the location of the supplier and the recipient within the country is immaterial for the purpose of CGST, SGST would be chargeable only when the supplier and the recipient are both located within the State. Illustration I: Suppose hypothetically that the rate of CGST is 10 per cent and that of SGST is 10 per cent. When a wholesale dealer of steel in Uttar Pradesh supplies steel bars and rods to a construction company which is also located within the same State for, say Rs 100, the dealer would charge CGST of Rs 10 and SGST of Rs 10 in addition to the basic price of the goods. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not actually pay Rs 20 (Rs 10 + Rs 10) in cash as he would be entitled to set off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchases (say, inputs). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on his purchases while for SGST he can utilize the credit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST. Illustration II: Suppose, again hypothetically, that the rate of CGST is 10 per cent and that of SGST is 10 per cent. When an advertising company located in Mumbai supplies advertising services to a company manufacturing soap also located within the State of Maharashtra for, let us say Rs 100, the ad company would charge CGST of Rs 10 as well as SGST of Rs 10 to the basic value of the service. He would be required to deposit the CGST component into a Central Government account while the SGST portion into the account of the concerned State Government. Of course, he need not again actually pay Rs 20 (Rs 10 + Rs 10) in cash as it would be entitled to set-off this liability against the CGST or SGST paid on his purchase (say, of inputs such as stationery, office equipment, services of an artist etc.). But for paying CGST he would be allowed to use only the credit of CGST paid on its purchase while for SGST he can utilise the redit of SGST alone. In other words, CGST credit cannot, in general, be used for payment of SGST. Nor can SGST credit be used for payment of CGST. 13) What are the benefits which the Country will accrue from GST? Introduction of GST would be a very significant step in the field of indirect tax reforms in India. By amalgamating a large number of Central and State taxes into a single tax and allowing set-off of prior-stage taxes, it would mitigate the ill effects of cascading and pave the way for a common national market. For the consumers, the biggest gain would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25 per cent - 30 per cent. Introduction of GST would also make our products competitive in the domestic and international markets. Studies show that this would instantly spur economic growth. There may also be revenue gain for the Centre and the States due to widening of the tax base, increase in trade volumes and improved tax compliance. Last but not the least, this tax, because of its transparent character, would be easier to administer. 14) What is IGST? Under the GST regime, an Integrated GST (IGST) would be levied and collected by the Centre on inter-State supply of goods and services. Under Article 269A of the Constitution, the GST on supplies in the course of inter-state trade or commerce shall be levied and collected by the Government of India and such tax shall be apportioned between the Union and the States in the manner as may be provided by Parliament by law on the recommendations of the Goods and Services Tax Council. 15) Who will decide rates for levy of GST? The CGST and SGST would be levied at rates to be jointly decided by the Centre and States. The rates would be notified on the recommendations of the GST Council. 16) What would be the role of GST Council? A GST Council would be constituted comprising the Union Finance Minister (who will be the Chairman of the Council), the Minister of State (Revenue) and the State Finance/Taxation Ministers to make recommendations to the Union and the States on (i) the taxes, cesses and surcharges levied by the Centre, the States and the local bodies which may be subsumed under GST; (ii) the goods and services that may be subjected to or exempted from the GST; (iii) the date on which the GST shall be levied on petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel; (iv) model GST laws,principles of levy,apportionment of IGST and the principles that govern the place of supply; (v) the threshold limit of turnover below which the goods and services may be exempted from GST; (vi) the rates including floor rates with bands of GST; (vii)any special rate or rates for a specified period to raise additional resources during any natural calamity or disaster; (viii) special provision with respect to the North East States, J and K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand; and (ix) any other matter relating to the GST, as the Council may decide. 17) What is the guiding principle of GST Council? The mechanism of GST Council would ensure harmonization on different aspects of GST between the Centre and the States as well as among States. It has been provided in the Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 that the GST Council, in its discharge of various functions, shall be guided by the need for a harmonized structure of GST and for the development of a harmonized national market for goodsand services. 18) How will decisions be taken by GST Council? The Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 provides that every decision of the GST Council shall be taken at a meeting by a majority of not less than 3/4th of the weighted votes of the Members present and voting.

One half of the total number of members of the GST Council shall constitute the quorum at its meetings. 19) Who is liable to pay GST under the proposed GST regime? Under the GST regime, tax is payable by the taxable person on the supply of goods and/or services. Liability to pay tax arises when the taxable person crosses the turnover threshold of Rs 20 lakhs (Rs 10 lakhs for NE and Special Category States) except in certain specified cases where the taxable person is liable to pay GST even though he has not crossed the threshold limit. The CGST / SGST is payable on all intra-State supply of goods and/or services and IGST is payable on all inter- State supply of goods and/or services. The CGST /SGST and IGST are payable at the ratesspecified in the Schedules to the respective Acts. 20) What are the benefits available to small tax payers under the GST regime? Tax payers with an aggregate turnover in a financial year u p t o [Rs.20 lakhs & Rs.10 Lakhs for NE and special category states] would be exempt from tax. Further, a person whose aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year is less than Rs.50 Lakhs can opt for a simplified composition scheme where tax will payable at a concessional rate on the turnover in a state. [Aggregate turnover shall include the aggregate value of all taxable supplies, exempt supplies and exports of goods and/or services and exclude taxes viz. GST.] Aggregate turnover shall be computed on all India basis. For NE States and special category states, the exemption threshold shall be [Rs 10 lakhs]. All taxpayers eligible for threshold exemption will have the option of paying tax with input tax credit (ITC) benefits. Tax payers making inter-State supplies or paying tax on reverse charge basis shall not be eligible for threshold exemption. 21) How will the goods and services be classified under GST regime? HSN (Harmonised System of Nomenclature) code shall be used for classifying the goods under the GST regime. Taxpayers whose turnover is above Rs 1.5 crores but below Rs 5 crores shall use 2-digit code and the taxpayers whose turnover is Rs 5 crores and above shall use 4-digit code. Taxpayers whose turnover is below Rs. 1.5 crores are not required to mention HSN Code in their invoices. Services will be classified as per the Services Accounting Code (SAC). 22) How will imports be taxed under GST? Imports of Goods and Services will be treated as inter-state supplies and IGST will be levied on import of goods and services into the country. The incidence of tax will follow the destination principle and the tax revenue in case of SGST will accrue to the State where the imported goods and services are consumed. Full and complete set-off will be available on the GST paid on import on goods and services. 23) How will Exports be treated under GST? Exports will be treated as zero rated supplies. No tax will be payable on exports of goods or services, however credit of input tax credit will be available and same will be available as refund to the exporters. The Exporter will have an option to either pay tax on the output and claimrefund of IGST or export under Bond without payment of IGST and claim refund of Input Tax Credit (ITC). 24) What is the scope of composition scheme under GST? Small taxpayers with an aggregate turnover in a preceding financial year up to [Rs 50 lakhs] shall be eligible for composition levy. Under the scheme, a taxpayer shall pay tax as a percentage of his turnover in a state during the year without the benefit of ITC. The rate of tax for CGST and SGST/UTGST shall not be less than [1 per cent for manufacturer & 0.5 per cent in other cases; 2.5 per cent for specific services as mentioned in para 6(b) of Schedule II Viz Serving of food or any other article for human consumption]. A tax payer opting for composition levy shall not collect any tax from his customers. The government may increase the above said limit of 50 lakhs rupees to up to one crore rupees, on the recommendationof GST Council. Tax payers making inter- state supplies or making supplies through e-commerce operators who are required to collect tax at source shall not be eligible for composition scheme. 25) Will the composition scheme be optional? Yes. 26) What is GSTN and its role in the GST regime? GSTN stands for Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN). A Special Purpose Vehicle called the GSTN has been set up to cater to the needs of GST. The GSTN shall provide a shared IT infrastructure and services to Central and State Governments, tax payers and other stakeholders for implementation of GST. The functions of the GSTN would, inter alia, include: (i) facilitating registration (ii) forwarding the returns to Central and State authorities (iii) computation and settlement of IGST (iv) matching of tax payment details with banking network (v) providing various MIS reports to the Central and the State Governments based on the tax payer return information (vi) providing analysis of tax payers' profile, and (vii) running the matching engine for matching, reversal and reclaim of input tax credit. The GSTN is developing a common GST portal and applications for registration, payment, return and MIS/reports. The GSTN would also be integrating the common GST portal with the existing tax administration IT systems and would be building interfaces for tax payers. Further, the GSTN is developing back-end modules like assessment, audit, refund, appeal etc. for 19 States and UTs (Model II States). The CBEC and Model I States (15 States) are themselves developing their GST back-end systems. Integration of GST front-end system with back-end systems will have to be completed and tested well in advance for making the transition smooth. 27) How are the disputes going to be resolved under the GST regime? The Constitution (one hundred and first amendment) Act, 2016 provides that the Goods and Services Tax Council shall establish a mechanism to adjudicate any dispute- between the Government of India and one or more States; or between the Government of India and any State or States on one side and one or more other Sates on the other side; or between two or more States, arising out of the recommendations of the Council or implementation thereof. 28) What is the purpose of compliance rating mechanism? As per Section 149 of the CGST/SGST Act, every registered person shall be assigned a compliance rating based on the record of compliance in respect of specified parameters. Such ratings shall also be placed in the public domain. A prospective client will be able to see the compliance ratings of suppliers and take a decision as to whether to deal with a particular supplier or not. This will create healthy competition amongst taxable persons. 29) Are actionable claims liable to GST? As per section 2(52) of the CGST/SGST Act actionable claims are to be considered as goods. Schedule III read with Section 7 of the CGST/SGST Act lists the activities or transactions which shall be treated neither as supply of goods nor supply of services. The Schedule lists actionable claims other than lottery, betting and gambling as one of such transactions. Thus only lottery, betting and gambling shall be treated as supplies under the GST regime. All the other actionable claims shall not be supplies. 30) Are transaction in securities be taxable in GST? Securities have been specifically excluded from the definition of goods as well as services. Thus, the transaction in securities shall not be liable to GST. 31) What is the concept of Information Return? Information return is based on the idea of verifying the compliance levels of registered persons through information procured from independent third party sources. As per section 150 of the CGST/SGST Act, many authorities who are responsible for maintaining records of registration or statement of accounts or any periodic return or document containing details of payment of tax and other details of transaction of goods or services or both ortransactions related to a bank account or consumption of electricity or transaction of purchase, sale or exchange of goods or property or right or interest in a property under any law for the time being in force, are mandated to furnish an information return of the same in respect of such periods, within such time, in such form and manner and to such authority or agency as may be prescribed. Failure to do so may result in penalty being imposed as per Section 123. 32) Different companies have different types of accounting software packages and no specific format are mandated for keeping records. How will department be able to read into these complex software? As per Section 153 of the CGST/SGST Act, having regard to the nature and complexity of a case and in the interest of revenue, department may take assistance from an expert at any state of scrutiny, inquiry, investigation or any other proceedings. 33) Is there any provision in GST for tax treatment of goods returned by the recipient? Yes, Section 34 deals with such situations. Where the goods supplied are returned by the recipient, the registered person (supplier of goods) may issue to the recipient a credit note containing the prescribed particulars. The details of the credit note shall be declared by the supplier in the returns for the month during which such credit note was issued but not later than September following the end of the year in which such supply was made or the date of filing of the relevant annual return, whichever is earlier. The details of the credit note shall be matched with the corresponding reduction in claim for input tax credit by the recipient in his valid return for the same tax period or any subsequent tax period and the claim for reduction in output tax liability by the supplier that matches with the corresponding reduction in claim for ITC by the recipient shall be finally accepted and communicated to both parties. 34) What is Anti-Profiteering measure? As per section 171 of the CGST/SGST Act, any reduction in rate of tax on any supply of goods or services or the benefit of input tax credit shall be passed on to the recipient by way of commensurate reduction in prices. An authority may be constituted by the government to examine whether input tax credits availed by any registered person or the reduction in the tax rate have actually resulted in a commensurate reduction in the price of the goods or services or both supplied by him. LEVY OF AND EXEMPTION FROM TAX 1) Where is the power to levy GST derived from? Article 246A of the Constitution, which was introduced by the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016 confers concurrent powers to both, Parliament and State Legislatures to make laws with respect to GST i.e. Central tax (CGST) and state tax (SGST) or union territory tax (UTGST). However, clause 2 of Article 246A read with Article 269A provides exclusive power to the Parliament to legislate with respect to inter-State trade or commerce i.e. Integrated tax (IGST). 2) What is the taxable event under GST? Taxable event under GST is supply of goods or services or both. CGST and SGST/ UTGST will be levied on intra-State supplies. IGST will be levied on inter-State supplies. 3) Whether supplies made without consideration will also come within the purview of supply under GST? Yes, but only those activities which are specified in Schedule I to the CGST Act / SGST Act. The said provision has been adopted in IGST Act as well as in UTGST Act also. 4) Will giving away essential commodities by a charitable institution be taxable activity? In order to be a supply which is taxable under GST, the transaction should be in the course or furtherance of business. As there is no quid pro quo involved in supply for charitable activities, it is not a supply under GST. 5) Who can notify a transaction to be supply of goods or services? Central Government or State Government, on the recommendations of the GST Council, can notify an activity to be the supply of goods and not supply of services or supply of services and not supply of goods or neither a supply of goods nor a supply of services. 6) What are composite supply and mixed supply? How are these two different from each other? Composite supply is a supply consisting of two or more taxable supplies of goods or services or both or any combination thereof, which are bundled in natural course and are supplied in conjunction with each other in the ordinary course of business and where one of which is a principal supply. For example, when a consumer buys a television set and he also gets warranty and a maintenance contract with the TV, this supply is a composite supply. In this example, supply of TV is the principal supply, warranty and maintenance service are ancillary. Mixed supply is combination of more than one individual supplies of goods or services or any combination thereof made in conjunction with each other for a single price, which can ordinarily be supplied separately. For example, a shopkeeper selling storage water bottles along with refrigerator. Bottles and the refrigerator can easily be priced and sold separately. 7) What is the treatment of composite supply and mixed supply under GST? Composite supply shall be treated as supply of the principal supply. Mixed supply would be treated as supply of that particular goods or services which attracts the highest rate of tax. 8) Are all goods and services taxable under GST? Supplies of all goods and services are taxable except alcoholic liquor for human consumption. Supply of petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly nown as petrol), natural gas and aviation turbine fuel shall be taxable with effect from a future date. This date would be notified by the Government on the recommendations of the GST Council. 9) What is meant by Reverse Charge? It means the liability to pay tax is on the recipient of supply of goods and services instead of the supplier of such goods or services in respect of notified categories of supply. 10) Is the reverse charge mechanism applicable only to services? No, reverse charge applies to supplies of both goods and services, as notified by the Government on the recommendations of the GST Council. 11) What will be the implications in case of receipt of supply from unregistered persons? In case of receipt of supply from an unregistered person, the registered person who is receiving goods or services shall be liable to pay tax under reverse charge mechanism. 12) Can any person other than the supplier or recipient be liable to pay tax under GST? Yes, the Central/State government can specify categories of services the tax on which shall be paid by the electronic commerce operator, if such services are supplied through it and all the provisions of the Act shall apply to such electronic commerce operator as if he is the person liable to pay tax in relation to supply of such services. 13) What is the threshold for opting to pay tax under the composition scheme? The threshold for composition scheme is Rs 50 lakh of aggregate turnover in the preceding financial year. The benefit of composition scheme can be availed up to the turnover of Rs 50 lakh in current financial year. 14) What are the rates of tax for composition scheme? There are different rates for different sectors. In normal cases of supplier of goods (i.e. traders), the composition rate is 0.5 % of the turnover in a State or Union territory. If the person opting for composition scheme is manufacturer, then the rate is 1 per cent of the turnover in a State or Union territory. In case of restaurant services, it is 2.5 per cent of the turnover in a State or Union territory. These rates are under one Act, and samerate would be applicable in the other Act also. So, effectively, the composition rates (combined rate under CGST and SGST/UTGST) are 1 per cent, 2 per cent and 5 per cent for normal supplier, manufacturer and restaurant service respectively. 15) A person availing composition scheme during a financial year crosses the turnover of Rs 50 lakh during the course of the year i.e. say he crosses the turnover of Rs 50 lakh in December? Will he be allowed to pay tax under composition scheme for the remainder of the year i.e. till 31st March? No. The option availed shall lapse from the day on which his aggregate turnover during the financial yearexceeds Rs 50 lakh. 16) Will a taxable person, having multiple registrations, be eligible to opt for composition scheme only for a few of registrations? All registered persons having the same Permanent Account Number (PAN) have to opt for composition scheme. If one registered person opts for normal scheme, others become ineligible for composition scheme. 17) Can composition scheme be availed of by a manufacturer and a service supplier? Yes, a manufacturer can opt for composition scheme generally. However, a manufacturer of goods, which would be notified on the recommendations of the GST Council, cannot opt for this scheme. This scheme is not available for services sector, except restaurants. Courtesy: Central Board of Excise and Customs. Also read: What is the GST bill?

(Wikimedia) Updated on May 20 The existing tax liabilities of homebuyers may remain unaffected after the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax regime. The GST council that decided the slabs for goods and services has brought the real estate sector under the GST ambit partially through works contracts. These will be taxed at 12 per cent under the GST regime. Currently, a homebuyer has to pay several indirect taxes, including excise duty, value-added tax and service tax, which amounts to a tax outgo of about 11 per cent, excluding stamp duty . Under the new regime, all the other indirect taxes will be subsumed and a buyer will have to pay a uniform 12 per cent tax on the purchase of real estate, except stamp duty. This is true for under construction properties but not on completed, ready-to-move-in apartments. On the other hand, entire input credit — excise duty and Central sales tax on construction materials that are paid by developers — will also be allowed unlike earlier. However, the government has yet to provide a clarity on the abatement rate for the land cost. Here is the complete list of GST rates . GST in India The Rajya Sabha had on August 3 and the Lok Sabha on August 8 unanimously approved the Bill to enable the rollout of GST, arguably the biggest tax reform in India in recent times. The approvals have paved the way for implementing the indirect tax regime within the Union government's revised deadline of April 1, 2017. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on November 3 set the rates for the new tax regime. These rates would range from 5 to 28 percent, with 12 percent and 18 percent as standard rates. While things of mass consumption would be taxed at the rate of five per cent, luxury would be taxed at 28 percent. Watch: GST Bill Gets President Pranab Mukherjee Nod Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had on August 3 tabled the Goods & Services Tax (GST) Constitutional Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha, and initiated a five-hour debate on the landmark tax reform. The proposed indirect tax regime, which is likely to subsume 17 indirect taxes upon implementation, will remove the disparity in the taxation structure across the country and bring one uniform tax rate. How will GST impact real estate? The real estate sector is estimated to account for about five per cent of India’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is considered the second-largest employer in the country, according to an E&Y report from 2015. However, the sector faces issues in terms of macroeconomic conditions and fiscal policy decisions. One such challenge is the management of the multiple indirect tax levies, such as VAT, service tax, excise, stamp duty and registration fees. As we prepare for GST 'how it works' might already be on your mind. Since the GST is to subsume multiple indirect taxes, it will simplify tax compliance and minimise the scope for double taxation. So, there is clear reason for home buyers to cheer, even if they have to pay slightly more in case the standard GST rate is high. On how GST will impact the real estate sector, Ankur Dhawan, chief business officer (resale), PropTiger, says: ""GST itself is expected to add about 2 per cent to India's gross domestic product (GDP). That is a substantial boost to the economy. If the economy does well, obviously, there will be more demand for real estate, and it will be a boost for the sector."" Why a slightly higher GST rate might be acceptable to buyers Since buyers are not liable to pay any indirect tax for the purchase of ready-to-move-in properties, the impact of GST on buyers of resale properties is likely to be very little. In the case of under-construction property transactions, buyers have to pay value-added tax (VAT) and service tax . While VAT is a state levy and its rate differs from one state to another, service tax is a central tax charged at 15 per cent. Overall, the current taxes on home purchase are not low and involve mind-boggling complexities. Most buyers of under-construction properties take home loans to fund their purchase and the whole mathematics involved in the home loan process is quite baffling, too. In most cases, buyers do not carry out a detailed study of the various taxes that they have to additionally pay and they make their investment plans based only on the value of the property. Also Read- GST: What's In Store For Real Estate Sector In the case of VAT, for example, there is little clarity on what amount is paid at which level, and what part of it is passed on by the developer to the buyer. Often, for want of more clarity on the VAT rate in his state – if at all the state is imposing VAT on real estate – a buyer has to rely on the clauses mentioned in his sale agreement with the developer. Unfortunately, no amount of research helps the buyer know the right rate? Lengthy government documents are mostly interpretative in nature and if you are not a professional chartered accountant, you might get lost in the study, and yet get little success. On the other hand, if there is a clear uniform rate for one tax that includes everything that they need to pay in taxes to authorities, the whole payment process would become very convenient for the buyer. In such a case, even a higher rate would be more acceptable to him than a lack of clarity. Why will developers love GST? Since the GST is actually expected to bring down the project cost for developers, this would mean homes would, in fact, become cheaper. There are many taxes and duties that a developer pays on the procurement side, such as Customs duty, Central Sales Tax, excise duty, entry tax, etc. These are subsequently passed on to the final pricing of the units and, thereby, to the buyer. As GST proposes to roll multiple taxes into one, the cost of construction will come down. This will bring more liquidity into the market and boost home sales. F ree flow of credit for developers will also translate into an increase in margin in their hands. ""There are a lot of products developers procure for construction of their projects on which there is double taxation at present. The cost they bear for these come to 20 to 25per cent of the cost of materials they are buying. So, with the GST rate, between 12% and 18%, it will reduce the cost of production for developers. This will be good for buyers, as developers will be able to pass a part of the benefit to them,"" Dhawan adds. For developers, the actual tax effect will be lower than the existing one mainly due to the input tax credit on raw materials that builders get against payment of taxes on inputs like steel and cement. Moreover, the increase in tax is very less for major inputs. The indirect taxes on steel were around 17% and that has now come to 18% under GST, similarly for cement the taxes totalled to nearly 24% which now has been standardized at 28%. The GST rate for work contracts has also been fixed at 12%. ""There is no doubt that GST will be a game-changer for Indian industry, including for the real estate sector, since it will subsume more than 16 major taxes and levies into a single consolidated tax. Additionally, the unified tax regime will stop the unwanted practice of double taxation, which hurt real estate and other sectors, given their cascading effect that inflated prices for end users. Though unorganised players are wary of GST’s impact, it will create a level playing field for organised entities; the former will now come within the tax ambit. With GST enforcing transparent transactions across all domains, this will be a blessing in disguise for real estate developers , too,"" says Aman Agarwal, director, KV Developers , and a member of the Naredco governing council. Through market mechanism, GST will impart more transparency to the sector, which faces a perception issue. GST would provide an audit trail for better control and monitoring of the sector. Also Read: Developers Expect A Positive Impact Of GST On Real Estate GST Timeline Updated on March 21, 2017: After the Goods and Services Tax Council on March 17 approved four Bills, the Cabinet has given its approval to these bills, too. Apart from the four Bills, the Council had also given a clearance to a proposal to charge a cess of 15 per cent on luxury cars and aerated drinks. Under the proposal, there would be a cess of 290 per cent on cigarettes. The four Bills approved by the council include the state GST (SGST), the Union Territory GST, the changes to the Central GST and integrated GST and compensation legislation. These Bills will soon be present to Parliament for approval. Updated on March 7, 2017: The government has clarified that property prices would not shoot up under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime. Addressing a two-day CREDAI conclave in New Delhi recently, Urban Development Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said property prices, especially of affordable housing, would not increase under the new tax regime.""We have already exempted affordable housing from service tax, and my ministry is addressing the need to continue this exemption under the GST. We have recommended to the Ministry of Finance to tax the sector at a rate which is revenue neutral and not at a higher tax rate,” Naidu said. Updated on January 17, 2017: The Centre and states have decided on sharing of powers for control over taxpayers under the Good and Services Tax (GST) regime. Under the consensus reached at the ninth meeting of the GST Council, states will be assessing and administering 90 per cent of the taxpayers falling under the Rs 1.5-crore annual turnover; the remaining would be controlled by the Centre. On the other hand, taxpayers with more than Rs 1.5 crore turnover will be administered by the Centre and states in a 50:50 ratio. However, the new tax regime will now be rolled out from July 1. According to earlier plans, the Centre had to roll out the GST regime from April 1. *** Update as on October 19: In its third meeting on October 17, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has proposed a four-tier structure for the new tax regime. The proposed regime will have a lower rate of six per cent, two standard rates of 12 per cent and 18 per cent, a higher rate of 26 per cent, and an additional cess on luxury and ""demerit"" products. According to media reports, while the higher rate for services under the indirect tax regime is proposed to be 18 per cent, essential services could be taxed at six per cent or 12 per cent. Around 70 per cent of the taxable base is proposed to be taxed at either 18 per cent, 12 per cent or six per cent, with more than 50 per cent of the items to be taxed at 12 per cent or 18 per cent,"" says a report by The Indian Express. *** Update as on September 27: The draft Goods & Services Tax (GST) rules were on September 27 put up for discussion ahead of a meeting of the Centre and states on September 30 to discuss the GST regulations. The finance ministry has reportedly sought a feedback on the draft rules, which are related to registration, invoicing, procedures and guidelines, by September 28. “The draft rules for registration, payments, invoice, etc, for GST are uploaded on CBEC website. Business community may view them and give quick comments, if any, by 28th night on gst-cbec@gov.in. We intend to have these rules approved by GST council in its meeting on 30th September. So that business systems can be modified by all,"" said Revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia in a series of posts on microblogging site Twitter. 1/3 The draft rules for registration, payments, invoice, etc for GST are uploaded on CBEC website. — Dr Hasmukh Adhia (@adhia03) September 26, 2016 2/3 Business community may view them and give quick comments, if any, by 28th night on gst-cbec@gov.in — Dr Hasmukh Adhia (@adhia03) September 26, 2016 3/3 We intend to have these rules approved by GST council in its meeting on 30th September. So that business systems can be modified by all. — Dr Hasmukh Adhia (@adhia03) September 26, 2016 *** Earlier, the Constitution Bill for the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in India, which was approved by President Pranab Mukherjee on September 8, had been notified as the Constitution (101st Amendment) Act, 2016, on September 10. According to Article 279A (1) of the amended Constitution, the GST Council has to be constituted by the President within 60 days of the commencement of Article 279A from September 12. According to Article 279A of the amended Constitution, the GST Council will be a joint forum of the Centre and states and shall consist of the following members: Chairperson: Union finance minister Member: The Union Minister of State for finance (in charge of revenue) Members: The ministers in charge of finance or taxation or any other minister nominated by each state government The Council will make recommendations to the Union and states governments on important issues related to GST, such as the goods and services that might be subjected or exempted from GST, model GST laws, principles that govern place of supply, threshold limits, GST rates, including the floor rates with bands, special rates for raising additional resources during natural calamities/disasters, special provisions for certain States, etc. *** (With inputs from Srinibas Rout) Tags: home buyers , service tax , home , Real Estate Market , Parliament #Budget2017: A Little Nudge And Realty Will Take That Big Leap Towards Recovery Despite all the doom and gloom stories one might be hearing bout India’s real estate, a close look at facts would tell you that the sector is actually headed to a grand re-launch and may spring to assert its position as the most preferred asset class.

With a singular impact on the economic growth of the country and the way business is done in India, it is expected to achieve the following: Convert India into one market by seamless flow of tax credits – today some taxes are not creditable when goods move outside an Indian State, service tax credit is not available to a trader or a services unit cannot claim credit of Value Added Tax (VAT) paid on goods Multiple taxes to be replaced by singular tax making compliance easier Number of tax rates to be reduced substantially making life easier and disputes lesser Compliance process to become uniform due to singular IT portal where business and government agencies interact – this can also reduce human interaction and bring transparency in operations Business decisions may not be driven by tax considerations as most of the taxes will be creditable, bringing in overall efficiency in business operations spurring economic growth Electronic filing and online credit matching would substantially reduce non-compliance and tax frauds – this may provide significant boost to honest businesses. Dual GST structure The central and state governments will levy GST simultaneously, on a common taxable value, on the supply of goods and services. IGST - an Indian innovation However, in the case of imports and inter- State supplies, an Integrated IGST (GST) shall be levied by the central government, proceeds of which will be shared by the central and the recipient state government. IGST is an Indian innovation which would help tax move along with goods/services, across states and therefore reduce refund situations at state borders. Destination based tax GST, is expected to bring a significant shift from origin-based taxation to a destination-based tax structure. This is likely to impact not only the operating business models but also the revenues of the centre/states. It has the potential to impact cash flow, pricing, working capital, supply chain and IT systems and hence provides an opportunity to transform your business. Goods and services will be taxed by both the governments Unlike today when services are taxed by the central government, sale of goods is taxed by the states while the manufacturer is taxed only by the central government, GST will allow equal opportunity to the centre and the state to tax all supplies of goods and services. In this respect, it establishes the truly federal character of Indian fiscal system.

It was introduced as The Constitution (One Hundred and First Amendment) Act 2016 , following the passage of Constitution 101 st Amendment Bill. The GST is governed by GST Council and its Chairman is Union Finance Minister of India - Arun Jaitley . This method allows GST-registered businesses to claim tax credit to the value of GST they paid on purchase of goods or services as part of their normal commercial activity. Administrative responsibility would generally rest with a single authority to levy tax on goods and services. [1] Exports would be considered as zero-rated supply and imports would be levied the same taxes as domestic goods and services adhering to the destination principle in addition to the Customs Duty which will not be subsumed in the GST. Introduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a significant step in the reform of indirect taxation in India. Amalgamating several Central and State taxes into a single tax [2] would mitigate cascading or double taxation, facilitating a common national market. The simplicity of the tax should lead to easier administration and enforcement. From the consumer point of view, the biggest advantage would be in terms of a reduction in the overall tax burden on goods, which is currently estimated at 25%-30%, free movement of goods from one state to another without stopping at state borders for hours for payment of state tax or entry tax and reduction in paperwork to a large extent. GST is expected to be applicable from 1 July 2017. [3] Contents 1 History 2 Effects of GST 3 GST on Exports 4 Legislation 5 GSTN 6 GSP 7 ASP 8 References 9 External links History [ edit ] Tax Regime in India The reform process in indirect tax regime of India was started in 1986 by Vishwanath Pratap Singh by introduction of Modified Value Added Tax (MODVAT). [4] Goods and services tax (GST) will subsume various indirect taxes including central excise duty , services tax , additional customs duty, surcharges , state-level value added tax and Octroi. [5] [6] Other levies which are currently applicable on inter-state transportation of goods are also likely to be done away with in GST regime. [7] [3] The following taxes will be bound together by the GST: Central Excise Duty Service Tax Countervailing Duty Special Countervailing Duty Value Added Tax (VAT) Central Sales Tax (CST) Octroi Entertainment Tax Entry Tax Purchase Tax Luxury Tax Advertisement taxes Taxes applicable on lotteries [8] GST is levied on all transactions such as sale, transfer, barter, lease, or import of goods and/or services. India will adopt a dual GST model, meaning that taxation is administered by both the Union and State Governments. Transactions made within a single state will be levied with Central GST ( CGST ) by the Central Government and State GST (SGST) by the government of that state. For inter-state transactions and imported goods or services, an Integrated GST (IGST) is levied by the Central Government. GST is a consumption based tax, therefore, taxes are paid to the state which the goods or services are consumed not the state in which they were produced. IGST simplifies tax collection for State Governments by enabling them to collect the tax owed to them directly from the Central Government. Under the previous system, a state would have to deal with multiple state governments in order to collect tax revenue. [8] Effects of GST [ edit ] The tax rate under GST may be nominal or zero rated for the time its charged. It has been proposed to insulate the revenues of the States from the impact of GST, with the expectation that in due course, GST will be levied on petroleum and petroleum products. The central government has assured states of compensation for any revenue losses incurred by them from the date of introduction of GST for a period of five years.Adarsh [9] GST on Exports [ edit ] Under the GST Law, export of goods or services are treated as Zero rated supplies, therefore, GST will not be charged on the export of goods or services. The credit on inputs used for making export supplies will be available to the exporter. The exporters have two options either to export goods under Bond and claim refund of input credit or to export goods under rebate claim and claim the refund of output tax. [10] Legislation [ edit ] The goods and services tax (GST) council chaired by finance minister Arun Jaitley has urged states to approve state GST laws by the end of May to smoothen the roll-out of the historic tax reform by its target date of 1st July. [11] As India is a federal republic , GST would be implemented concurrently by the central governments. [12] A 21-member select committee was formed to look into the proposed GST law. [13] Section 9 is the charging section for CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017), which gives power to central government to levy tax on intra state taxable supply. [14] There will be no GST on the sale and purchase of securities. That will continue to be governed by Securities Transaction Tax (STT). [15] GSTN [ edit ] Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) is a nonprofit organization formed to create a platform for all the concerned parties i.e. stakeholders, government, taxpayers to collaborate on a single portal. The portal will be accessible to the central government which will track down every transaction on its end while the taxpayers will be having a vast service to return file their taxes and maintain the details. The IT network will be developed by private firms which are being in tie up with the central government and will be having stakes accordingly. The known authorized capital of GSTN is ? 10 crore (US$1.6 million) in which Central Government holds 24.5 percent of shares while the state government holds 24.5 percent and rest with private banking firms. [16] GSP [ edit ] GSP stands for GST Suvidha Provider. To handle the huge IT requirements, the government, GSTN has entrusted GSPs with the responsibility of providing the much needed support to taxpayers in the IT ecosystem for GST. But, while the extent of support provided by a GSP may be limited to providing enriched access to the G2B portal, support provided by ASPs will extend much further and will address most taxpayer compliance difficulties. ASP [ edit ] ASP stands for Application Service Provider. ASPs will act as a link between the taxpayers and the GSPs. ASPs will focus on taking taxpayers’ raw data on sales and purchases and converting it into the GST returns. This GST returns will then be filed on behalf of the filer with GSTN via the GSP. It’s a kind of sub-license generation. Major ASPs include ClearTax , JioGST, sahiGST etc. [17] References [ edit ] ^ http://www.idtc.icai.org/download/BGM-on-GST-march-15.pdf ^ ""Which of the existing taxes are proposed to be subsumed under GST? - GST India Forum"" . gstindia.net .
